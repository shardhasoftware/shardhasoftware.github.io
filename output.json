I must admit, upon entering the restaurant, I was a little skeptical (as I glimpsed paper plates being used). Definitely worth saying here - don't judge a book by its cover! The pizza was incredible! We ordered a 20\" half and half (one half:chorizo, coriander and corn, second half: ricotta, mushroom and chilli) and I couldn't help but gasp in awe when it hovered above our heads and served to our table. The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion). They also provided us with a pizza cutter (which always a plus in my books), which provided me with great entertainment as I watched my friends attempting to equally divide this gigantic creation!!"

I don't know if its the best pizza I have ever had, its good and the novelty 20\" size (two toping choice possible) is a great idea but to be honest it was a little bit floppy when cut. - a few people complain the cutters are blunt, and yeah they are but they get the job done!We turned up on a friday evening and had to put our name down for a table of 6. We were told it would be 30 minutes and turned up a little late, this was lucky as the table wasnt yet ready. When it was ready turned out they thought we said 3 people, to there credit they quickly sourced another table for three but in a different paet of the restaurant...... after a little chat with some other patrons we managed to get a table altogether. They have a good selection of beers and we had a cracking meal. The waitress was helpful with suggestions and also joined in on the lad banter that was going on. My one concern with this place is its very small and if you turn up at the wrong time you may just have to go hungry. :-("

It's enough to say, the pizza here is Amazing. You either buy slices (£4) or share a large pizza for £20. Definitely doable for two people, or perfect to share between 3. We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever. Still, I don't feel we missed out on my first visit here.It can be busy at lunch time, but the wait was only 20 min. They take your number so you can walk around covent garden and before you know it your table is ready. Definitely worth the wait!"

After dinner there, I was told that this was his best date ever and I think it may be because of this place. The atmosphere was buzzing and the music was spot on to my taste. The seating was also highly in demand so you can tell how popular this place is. It is rightly so a hidden gem that is not given enough credit. I have friends in NYC who have family that own a stone-baked pizza company and I mentioned this place. I told them that they have competition trans Atlantic. Haha!"

But difinetly the 'Pizza' is good. Though I am a vegan; ( no animal by-products) a Culinary study at a California Chef Vegan school would greatly enhance your costumers smile's. The uninformed about 'vegan' foods is a bit less than one imagines....Sooooooo advertise the 'ingriedents' promotely with a 'simple' type writer size sheet of paper upon the entrance doors window...or where the menu is located outside on the window of your 'dining establishment.    Success.

Gourmet ingredients.Staff is very friendly and master at managing the masses storming the gates (and they are always storming the gates.)The place itself is chill and fun. Long, shared tables (count on a quasi-public conversation and the occasional bumped elbows), but everyone is jovial and having fun.First time I discovered this place, I ate there three times that first week. Now I have to force myself to only go twice (for my waistline) as Homeslice is just...that...good."

For flavourful, amazing pizza, there is just no place better.They bring out gigantic 20\" pizzas and hand you a pizza cutter, at which point everyone gets stuck in! At 20 pounds a pizza I think it's very reasonable.I especially like the Corn, Chorizo, & Coriander Pizza. I'm also a huge fan of their Cauliflower Cheese Pizza (it's got some sort of venison sausage on it as well), and the Lamb Shoulder, Watercress, Tomato, Red-Wine-Soaked Goat Cheese. Pro tip: This place gets incredibly packed. Ideally, you should only come with one other person, thus minimizing your wait time. Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend. Luckily, Neal's Yard is a really cool area and there are a lot of shops/pubs to explore nearby while you wait."

        "comments": "I can't help but say this place is overrated. It's good pizza but it's really 3-4 stars and no more than that. I tried each of the three slices (margerita/salami/artichoke). All were good but none were great. Too little sauce on some. Too little cheese on others. Most of the toppings seemed to be just tossed onto a regular slice that was warned up for a minute or two. Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices."

I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal."

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

        "comments": "This is one of my go-to places for a work week lunch. Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

It's filling in a carbolicious way but it has a ceiling as to how good it can really beHomeslice has a good reputation and I was able to join a little band of Yelpers yesterday to finally sample it. There was a nice smell pervading the small restaurant space in Neal's Yard when I arrived but as there's a no booking policy, our group faced a 45 minute wait on arrival. However, what was a bit off-putting was that my friend and I were given the hint twice to go away despite there being  more than enough room in the restaurant to wait. Then, no sooner had we sat down in a nearby coffeeshop when we were then summoned back as our table was ready.The small space is compact with stools and low tables but they have been clever with providing things like hooks for coats. Be prepared to share tables. The menu of pizza is up on the wall with old classics mixed with some innovative combos - all pizzas are £20 and you can mix 2 flavours on one pizza. They have an innovative way of selling wine in a large bottle and you're charged by them measuring the amount remaining in the bottle. The music was too loud with conversation taking place with uncomfortable shouting across the tableBut the food, the food, I hear you cry. Well, I did like the toppings with the butternut, bacon, stichelton and smoked onion being my favourite combo. However, the base didn't impress me - it was soft, making it hard to cut with the blunt pizza cutter. The middle of the pizza was too floppy, making eating the pizza very messy as fillings kept falling off. The edge was too doughy and most of our group left our crusts. I like my pizza bases more crispySorry, Homeslice but I can't really add my glowing love for you"

So you can imagine how I feel about the trend of London restaurants making me wait in line for  the pleasure of eating food.Luckily Homeslice avoid my wrath by letting you leave a number and wander off for a drink. Add to that that they serve basically the best pizza I've ever eaten and they've avoided my ire entirely.With an ever-changing menu a return trip can be a little heart-wrenching (oh, Lincolnshire poacher how could you desert me?) but their menu options are always amazing and original (mint pesto? sure, why not?). The 20inch half and half is definitely the way to go and I've, so far, never been disappointed.I'm also overly fond of the giant wine bottles that they then measure to work out your bill; but that's primarily because that, paired with a giant pizza, means I can pretend to be a borrower. Always a good time.I've been here a few times now and will no doubt be back again. I just hope that they manage to open a larger version at some point - it is sometimes nice not to eat with a stranger's elbow in your side..."

The rest need to be bought as a £20 pizza - its recommended you share these and the restaurant will happily make them half one topping and half another.Positives:+ Pizzas (I tried 2) were really tasty, we finished all of our pizza easily.+ There are also some imaginative options (e.g. the cauliflower cheese pizza)+ Service was quick+ Decent value for moneyOn the other hand:- Limited tables for groups of 6+- Most choices require you to buy the 20\" pizza for £20 so not great unless you're at least 2 people, really hungry (I reckon I could eat a whole one myself if necessary, they're quite thin) or happy to take leftovers home- Our crusts were very salty, I liked the taste but that much salt must be v bad...Overall: We've become very picky about our Friday lunches as spoilt for choice around Covent Garden but we agreed unanimously that we'll come back here.

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around £44 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends. Also note that this place is particularly busy so it does get really loud. This doesn't diminish the excellent service that we had. I would come back again!"

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy.

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza.

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around £44 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends. Also note that this place is particularly busy so it does get really loud. This doesn't diminish the excellent service that we had. I would come back again!"

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu. The place does get pretty full, so try to come at a time you think it will be less crowded."

Only slightly more private though as they crammed in to close to each other that the couple next to us had to move their table about a foot for me to get through the gap! The vibe is cool here though and it reminded me a lot of some of the pizza joints in New York, with the pizza taking up most of the table, no cutlery and paper plates.Our good friend Kirsty was with us this evening so we ordered a few a Camden Hells Lager each and got down to choosing our toppings. Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime. I'm very keen to go back and their interesting, exciting toppings certainly help them stand apart from the competition."

And this would be the song: When the mooooon hits your eye like a biig pizza pie, it's amoooreee....I'm not a pizza person, but Homeslice is a yummy exception I am happy to make. Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy. I appreciate that they offer the choice of flavours with tomato sauce and others with white sauce."

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

I usually don't like eating in public, especially when there is so many people looking at me. My room mates ordered for home the biggest pizza I have seen. Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza. The only waiting you have to do is while the pretty baked good comes to you, as often there is a crowd of hungry people who are also waiting."

Very fresh tasting with bold exciting flavours.The sumac yoghurt was a tad too liberally applied so overpowered the rest of the toppings but nonetheless was truly great.The real showstopper was the BBQ brisket which was an inspired choice.These pizza's are huge so one can be comfortably shared by two people unless you feel brave and go for one each (I did and had LOTS of leftovers).Drink selection was limited but they offered me a Brixton beer which is now a new fave.Win win."

Whty do they have to close the kitchen at 20 on Sunday?!?! I mean there is really no reason for doing it, why should I have a pizza at midday? Just pay the damn pizza man a little bit more and make him work on sunday night, damn it!Anyway, we finally managed to come in at 19:55 and still be able to order two pizzas in three. If you are hungry, you can go for one each (Don't listen to Rob, he's just inventing as he probably ate three pizzas alone). Now, the list of pizzas is constantly changing, and that's a very good thing, as they usually have something strange among them, last time was haggis. Yes, Haggis!! and it was damn good!The pizza itself: as everybody else is saying, it's on a 20\" massive thing with one or two topping styles on it, you slice it (I love to slice pizzas!) and you eat it! The pizza is of course thin, as a 20\" Naples pizza would fill an elephant after half of it, but they are really good in not letting it become too wet in the middle, and the result is that the pizza is good both on the sides and at the center, not that easy to find, compliments to the guy who built their oven as he really know how to do his job!Other than the haggis, however, the ingredients are not that good. I mean, they are not bad, but Pilgrims is light-years far from it. Still, I loved this place, especially for us, eating pizza almost once per week, it's nice sometimes to change place, and I will surely come back to this place sooner. AND I'd love to see the damn kitchen open till 22 on Sunday. Damn."

The waitresses are not-in-your-face cool, maneuvering around the many little tables with giant pizzas and a good attitude.The restaurant is filled with 20somethings, primarily in groups of 2, shouting at each other over jaw-droppingly/conversation-startingy large pizzas with unlikely toppings. The fairly small room is quickly filled with the impressive pizza oven, the cooks throwing their dough in the air, the waiters' explanations of how this all works, the loud music and all the chatter. You get one giant 20 inch pizza for £20 which you can split in half by topping. There are 10 choices only written on a chalkboard, because menus are so 2014.We went for the classic salami, rocket and parmesan, with mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds and chili flakes (but, were vey tempted by the goat shoulder with red kale and sumac yoghurt!). Pizzas arrived quickly and were eaten off paper plates - who needs table space for plates when you have a giant pizza? You get your own pizza slicer, which in our case led to some irregularly sized slices... Sharing napkins and condiments between tables is encouraged and adds to the warm buzz of the place.The dough was thin, the crust was soft, the toppings are very well put together. The ricotta was so fresh, the salami wasn't greasy - you can almost pretend you're eating healthily. The chili flakes and pumpkin seeds gave the pizza a kick without making it too alien. I found the bottom of the pizza a little smokier than I would have preferred, but devoured all the crust, because it was incredible. Generally, one of the best pizzas in London.We went at 10pm and there was no queue, but larger groups behind us couldn't find an available table anymore. Definitely worth a try in a small group at an awkward hour!USP: Giant sharing pizzas, good price, gourmet toppings, (cool name).Go with: Somebody you don't mind shouting at, that can both share and eat. I'd say bff, sibling, fourth date.Price: Low - £10 will fill you up!Comparison: Similar style to Franco Manca in terms of interesting toppings, dough was more similar to Pizza Pilgrims, but major wins on size of pizza for price, and collaborative atmosphere."

You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

I usually don't like eating in public, especially when there is so many people looking at me. My room mates ordered for home the biggest pizza I have seen. Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza. The only waiting you have to do is while the pretty baked good comes to you, as often there is a crowd of hungry people who are also waiting."

Very fresh tasting with bold exciting flavours.The sumac yoghurt was a tad too liberally applied so overpowered the rest of the toppings but nonetheless was truly great.The real showstopper was the BBQ brisket which was an inspired choice.These pizza's are huge so one can be comfortably shared by two people unless you feel brave and go for one each (I did and had LOTS of leftovers).Drink selection was limited but they offered me a Brixton beer which is now a new fave.Win win."

The Salami, Rocket and Parmesan was nice but the Goat Shoulder with Savoy Cabbage and Sumac Yogurt, though it sounded weird was fantastic. Nice intimate vibe inside in Covent Garden and some tasty pizza to match,"

Whty do they have to close the kitchen at 20 on Sunday?!?! I mean there is really no reason for doing it, why should I have a pizza at midday? Just pay the damn pizza man a little bit more and make him work on sunday night, damn it!Anyway, we finally managed to come in at 19:55 and still be able to order two pizzas in three. If you are hungry, you can go for one each (Don't listen to Rob, he's just inventing as he probably ate three pizzas alone). Now, the list of pizzas is constantly changing, and that's a very good thing, as they usually have something strange among them, last time was haggis. Yes, Haggis!! and it was damn good!The pizza itself: as everybody else is saying, it's on a 20\" massive thing with one or two topping styles on it, you slice it (I love to slice pizzas!) and you eat it! The pizza is of course thin, as a 20\" Naples pizza would fill an elephant after half of it, but they are really good in not letting it become too wet in the middle, and the result is that the pizza is good both on the sides and at the center, not that easy to find, compliments to the guy who built their oven as he really know how to do his job!Other than the haggis, however, the ingredients are not that good. I mean, they are not bad, but Pilgrims is light-years far from it. Still, I loved this place, especially for us, eating pizza almost once per week, it's nice sometimes to change place, and I will surely come back to this place sooner. AND I'd love to see the damn kitchen open till 22 on Sunday. Damn."

The waitresses are not-in-your-face cool, maneuvering around the many little tables with giant pizzas and a good attitude.The restaurant is filled with 20somethings, primarily in groups of 2, shouting at each other over jaw-droppingly/conversation-startingy large pizzas with unlikely toppings. The fairly small room is quickly filled with the impressive pizza oven, the cooks throwing their dough in the air, the waiters' explanations of how this all works, the loud music and all the chatter. You get one giant 20 inch pizza for £20 which you can split in half by topping. There are 10 choices only written on a chalkboard, because menus are so 2014.We went for the classic salami, rocket and parmesan, with mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds and chili flakes (but, were vey tempted by the goat shoulder with red kale and sumac yoghurt!). Pizzas arrived quickly and were eaten off paper plates - who needs table space for plates when you have a giant pizza? You get your own pizza slicer, which in our case led to some irregularly sized slices... Sharing napkins and condiments between tables is encouraged and adds to the warm buzz of the place.The dough was thin, the crust was soft, the toppings are very well put together. The ricotta was so fresh, the salami wasn't greasy - you can almost pretend you're eating healthily. The chili flakes and pumpkin seeds gave the pizza a kick without making it too alien. I found the bottom of the pizza a little smokier than I would have preferred, but devoured all the crust, because it was incredible. Generally, one of the best pizzas in London.We went at 10pm and there was no queue, but larger groups behind us couldn't find an available table anymore. Definitely worth a try in a small group at an awkward hour!USP: Giant sharing pizzas, good price, gourmet toppings, (cool name).Go with: Somebody you don't mind shouting at, that can both share and eat. I'd say bff, sibling, fourth date.Price: Low - £10 will fill you up!Comparison: Similar style to Franco Manca in terms of interesting toppings, dough was more similar to Pizza Pilgrims, but major wins on size of pizza for price, and collaborative atmosphere."

Once I'd hidden in the corner for a while.The décor is nice and I think 'nice' is the best word for it. Some school-esque coat hooks on the walls, church pew benches, couple of faux vintage mirrors, the odd chalk menu board. But it does have lovely high ceilings, so there's a very welcome sense of space - it feels relaxed, which is always good for pizza place.Homeslice does 20\" pizzas (which I'll definitely try on my own at some point - challenge accepted.) but my girlfriend and I have a couple of the £4 single slices with some of the on-tap frizzante wine. The big pizzas have some 'interesting combinations, with two in particular catching my eye for future reference: Haggis, leek & ogleshield (apparently it's a kind of cheese) and pulled pork, mint & walnut pesto.But the slices we went for, and what we thought of them, were:-    Courgette and artichoke, with a white sauce base - the garlic of the white sauce pretty much overpowered the others flavours, but I like garlic, so I really enjoyed it-    Salami and rocket, on a tomato base - very nice. Tasty and fresh. A solid thin-crust pizza, but perhaps a little light on ingredients.The frizzante was good - light, sweet, and went perfectly with the pizza. And the glass was full to the top. Vital!Overall, I actually really like Homeslice. A fairly vanilla setting, but it's so nice to be somewhere that feels light and spacious for once. The food? Tasty and pretty reasonably priced. The service? That's something that Homeslice does really well. Polite, friendly, helpful, and efficient throughout, and service wasn't added to the bill automatically - a small but nice change. Plus, we were automatically given a bottle of tap water as soon as we sat down. Civilised.I've used words like 'nice' in this review, that's exactly what I'll want every so often, and Homeslice delivers."

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around £44 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends.

Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu.

And this would be the song: When the mooooon hits your eye like a biig pizza pie, it's amoooreee....I'm not a pizza person, but Homeslice is a yummy exception I am happy to make. Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy. I appreciate that they offer the choice of flavours with tomato sauce and others with white sauce."

And this would be the song: When the mooooon hits your eye like a biig pizza pie, it's amoooreee....I'm not a pizza person, but Homeslice is a yummy exception I am happy to make. Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy. I appreciate that they offer the choice of flavours with tomato sauce and others with white sauce."

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

I usually don't like eating in public, especially when there is so many people looking at me. My room mates ordered for home the biggest pizza I have seen. Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza. The only waiting you have to do is while the pretty baked good comes to you, as often there is a crowd of hungry people who are also waiting."

Very fresh tasting with bold exciting flavours.The sumac yoghurt was a tad too liberally applied so overpowered the rest of the toppings but nonetheless was truly great.The real showstopper was the BBQ brisket which was an inspired choice.These pizza's are huge so one can be comfortably shared by two people unless you feel brave and go for one each (I did and had LOTS of leftovers).Drink selection was limited but they offered me a Brixton beer which is now a new fave.Win win."

The Salami, Rocket and Parmesan was nice but the Goat Shoulder with Savoy Cabbage and Sumac Yogurt, though it sounded weird was fantastic. Nice intimate vibe inside in Covent Garden and some tasty pizza to match,"

Whty do they have to close the kitchen at 20 on Sunday?!?! I mean there is really no reason for doing it, why should I have a pizza at midday? Just pay the damn pizza man a little bit more and make him work on sunday night, damn it!Anyway, we finally managed to come in at 19:55 and still be able to order two pizzas in three. If you are hungry, you can go for one each (Don't listen to Rob, he's just inventing as he probably ate three pizzas alone). Now, the list of pizzas is constantly changing, and that's a very good thing, as they usually have something strange among them, last time was haggis. Yes, Haggis!! and it was damn good!The pizza itself: as everybody else is saying, it's on a 20\" massive thing with one or two topping styles on it, you slice it (I love to slice pizzas!) and you eat it! The pizza is of course thin, as a 20\" Naples pizza would fill an elephant after half of it, but they are really good in not letting it become too wet in the middle, and the result is that the pizza is good both on the sides and at the center, not that easy to find, compliments to the guy who built their oven as he really know how to do his job!Other than the haggis, however, the ingredients are not that good. I mean, they are not bad, but Pilgrims is light-years far from it. Still, I loved this place, especially for us, eating pizza almost once per week, it's nice sometimes to change place, and I will surely come back to this place sooner. AND I'd love to see the damn kitchen open till 22 on Sunday. Damn."

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy.

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu.

And this would be the song: When the mooooon hits your eye like a biig pizza pie, it's amoooreee....I'm not a pizza person, but Homeslice is a yummy exception I am happy to make. Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy. I appreciate that they offer the choice of flavours with tomato sauce and others with white sauce."

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu. The place does get pretty full, so try to come at a time you think it will be less crowded."

Only slightly more private though as they crammed in to close to each other that the couple next to us had to move their table about a foot for me to get through the gap! The vibe is cool here though and it reminded me a lot of some of the pizza joints in New York, with the pizza taking up most of the table, no cutlery and paper plates.Our good friend Kirsty was with us this evening so we ordered a few a Camden Hells Lager each and got down to choosing our toppings. Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime. I'm very keen to go back and their interesting, exciting toppings certainly help them stand apart from the competition."

And this would be the song: When the mooooon hits your eye like a biig pizza pie, it's amoooreee....I'm not a pizza person, but Homeslice is a yummy exception I am happy to make. Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy. I appreciate that they offer the choice of flavours with tomato sauce and others with white sauce."

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

I usually don't like eating in public, especially when there is so many people looking at me. My room mates ordered for home the biggest pizza I have seen. Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza. The only waiting you have to do is while the pretty baked good comes to you, as often there is a crowd of hungry people who are also waiting."

Very fresh tasting with bold exciting flavours.The sumac yoghurt was a tad too liberally applied so overpowered the rest of the toppings but nonetheless was truly great.The real showstopper was the BBQ brisket which was an inspired choice.These pizza's are huge so one can be comfortably shared by two people unless you feel brave and go for one each (I did and had LOTS of leftovers).Drink selection was limited but they offered me a Brixton beer which is now a new fave.Win win."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu. The place does get pretty full, so try to come at a time you think it will be less crowded."

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around £44 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends. Also note that this place is particularly busy so it does get really loud. This doesn't diminish the excellent service that we had. I would come back again!"

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

When you come to leave, they measure the wine drunk with a ruler and charge you accordingly.It's a little hidden away, but it's worth the search to find it - highly recommended."

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

You can get half and half on a whole pizza which is 20 pounds or by the slice is 4. The wine we got was just a house red. Tasty for being a house wine. They give you 1.5 liters of wine and charge you for every glass you drink. There are 11 glasses in each bottle and we finished the bottle. The glasses are four pounds each so we spent 44 on wine. 64 total for 4 people in Covent garden area is not bad at all. I would recommend putting your name in and going to a nearby pub though because the wait is typically pretty long. Fabulous pizza and the weight staff was pretty friendly! I'll be going back next time I'm in London."

Let's start with the pizza. Huge pies, thin slices, served on paper plates with no utensils. I think this might freak Londoners out, not being able to cut your pizza with a fork and knife. However, as an American who loves finger food, I'm all for it. I'm a big fan of a pie that has salami and rocket but you can do half and half, which is useful for parties with different tastes. The wine is house BUT it is perfect for those who want more than one glass but don't want to commit to a full bottle. I've only had the red-- it wasn't the best wine I've ever had, but I like that i only pay for what I drink. All in all, I would definitely recommend!"

The last-minute actuality: Nava, Adam and I went for cocktails nearby until the other half was free and the four of us went to get some pizza. There were four of us, so no reservations, but they kindly took my phone number to call us when our table was ready.The only downside is the place is small. The tables are small. There were people spilling over into our area when we first sat down, but once they left we had quite a bit more room.They keep is super simple. £20 a pie which you can order half-and-half if you like. They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's £44. (And for a magnum! That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied. And I know I'll be back when I'm craving one of the best pizzas in London."

I prefer more of a NY style pizza - and found the crust to be not so yummy and the bottom too soft and also burnt in some spaces.

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

It's ruined pizza for me, possibly till I can visit Italy.The pizza was excellent. -The toppings were fresh and came in inspired combinations- The chilli oil was both hot and had a rich texture - a rare partnership- The choice to have a half/half pizza is never found outside of the chains and breaks the monotony of eating the same slice, after slice, after slice..- Staff were extremely friendly- Decor was warm and welcoming, albeit the tables were a little cramped considering the huge sizes of the pizzas themselves- Oh yeah, the pizzas are huge. One was more than enough for two very hungry men.This all came for under £15 a head in Convent Garden. Home Slice feels like a friend who desperately wants you to like it and boy, it's easy to like."

I prefer more of a NY style pizza - and found the crust to be not so yummy and the bottom too soft and also burnt in some spaces. The sauce, though was quite yummy.If you're in the neighborhood, shopping or roaming around central - stop by for a relaxed slice or two but don't expect to have your socks totally blown off."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution.

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's £44. (And for a magnum! That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied.

You can get half and half on a whole pizza which is 20 pounds or by the slice is 4. The wine we got was just a house red. Tasty for being a house wine. They give you 1.5 liters of wine and charge you for every glass you drink. There are 11 glasses in each bottle and we finished the bottle. The glasses are four pounds each so we spent 44 on wine. 64 total for 4 people in Covent garden area is not bad at all. I would recommend putting your name in and going to a nearby pub though because the wait is typically pretty long. Fabulous pizza and the weight staff was pretty friendly! I'll be going back next time I'm in London."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

And of course local draught  beer is extra bonus. Friendly staff is more than happy to recommend you their favourite pizza.  And let me tell you I have few favourites there! I guess you know where I am going with this : yes the pizza is really good. Usually you cannot measure quality by quantity, not in here though. Just wait till you see the size of it.

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

Let's start with the pizza. Huge pies, thin slices, served on paper plates with no utensils. I think this might freak Londoners out, not being able to cut your pizza with a fork and knife. However, as an American who loves finger food, I'm all for it. I'm a big fan of a pie that has salami and rocket but you can do half and half, which is useful for parties with different tastes. The wine is house BUT it is perfect for those who want more than one glass but don't want to commit to a full bottle. I've only had the red-- it wasn't the best wine I've ever had, but I like that i only pay for what I drink. All in all, I would definitely recommend!"

If you've got a big group, go outside of the typical lunch/dinner rushes and you should be fine. You can ask for two flavours on one 20\" pizza if you want to try more combinations. Courgette and artichoke is surprisingly good."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

I'm from New York and I've had some good pizza, but this was by far one of the best pies I've ever had. My friend and I ordered the 20 inch pie with half salami/rocket, half cauliflower cheese/auberjine/spinach.

The pizza was a little oily but still fine.  The size is great for sharing between 2 or 3.The wine model is great - they basically just leave a massive bottle on the table and you help yourself. When you come to leave, they measure the wine drunk with a ruler and charge you accordingly.It's a little hidden away, but it's worth the search to find it - highly recommended."

And of course local draught  beer is extra bonus. Friendly staff is more than happy to recommend you their favourite pizza.  And let me tell you I have few favourites there! I guess you know where I am going with this : yes the pizza is really good. Usually you cannot measure quality by quantity, not in here though. Just wait till you see the size of it.

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

You can get half and half on a whole pizza which is 20 pounds or by the slice is 4. The wine we got was just a house red. Tasty for being a house wine. They give you 1.5 liters of wine and charge you for every glass you drink. There are 11 glasses in each bottle and we finished the bottle. The glasses are four pounds each so we spent 44 on wine. 64 total for 4 people in Covent garden area is not bad at all. I would recommend putting your name in and going to a nearby pub though because the wait is typically pretty long. Fabulous pizza and the weight staff was pretty friendly! I'll be going back next time I'm in London."

There were people spilling over into our area when we first sat down, but once they left we had quite a bit more room.They keep is super simple. £20 a pie which you can order half-and-half if you like. They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's £44. (And for a magnum! That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied.

My friend and I ordered the 20 inch pie with half salami/rocket, half cauliflower cheese/auberjine/spinach. Both were amazing!Definitely my goto spot for when I'm craving wonderfully made thin crust pizza"

The pizza was a little oily but still fine.  The size is great for sharing between 2 or 3.The wine model is great - they basically just leave a massive bottle on the table and you help yourself. When you come to leave, they measure the wine drunk with a ruler and charge you accordingly.It's a little hidden away, but it's worth the search to find it - highly recommended."

And of course local draught  beer is extra bonus. Friendly staff is more than happy to recommend you their favourite pizza.  And let me tell you I have few favourites there! I guess you know where I am going with this : yes the pizza is really good. Usually you cannot measure quality by quantity, not in here though. Just wait till you see the size of it. Did you ever wanted to visit the land of giants? :-)"

The last-minute actuality: Nava, Adam and I went for cocktails nearby until the other half was free and the four of us went to get some pizza. There were four of us, so no reservations, but they kindly took my phone number to call us when our table was ready.The only downside is the place is small. The tables are small. There were people spilling over into our area when we first sat down, but once they left we had quite a bit more room.They keep is super simple. £20 a pie which you can order half-and-half if you like. They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's £44. (And for a magnum! That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied. And I know I'll be back when I'm craving one of the best pizzas in London."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan.

It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

You can split the toppings if you want, which allows for trying out different toppings at once. Also should you want just a slice you can from their regular pizzas. However at £4 a slice the value isnt great. The pizzas are £20 each, which between 3/4 is totally excellent value, because:THE PIZZAS ARE BLOODY AMAZING!!!!!!Oh my word, garlicy, cripsy and soft, with generous toppings, exotic but balanced. I'm salivating just thinking about this place.Every time i've been its been rammed, regardless of which day of the night it is, so book ahead.

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

It definitely was a bit tricky to eat this pizza with no utensils.We opted for a half half of oxtail and salami which set us back 20GBP for a giant 20in pizza. They also offer some pizzas by the slice. The pizza crust was thin and crispy which was great for the first couple of slices but as the minutes ticked by it inevitably got softer and harder to eat. This is where the fork would have come in handy! The oxtail was good but a bit heavy on the horseradish. The salami was yum. Lots of crispy salami pieces topped with rocket!Seating can be a cramped here and it was hard to get in and out as the seats are pretty close together."

You can split the toppings if you want, which allows for trying out different toppings at once. Also should you want just a slice you can from their regular pizzas. However at £4 a slice the value isnt great. The pizzas are £20 each, which between 3/4 is totally excellent value, because:THE PIZZAS ARE BLOODY AMAZING!!!!!!Oh my word, garlicy, cripsy and soft, with generous toppings, exotic but balanced. I'm salivating just thinking about this place.Every time i've been its been rammed, regardless of which day of the night it is, so book ahead. Failing that we never had to wait too long for one, and just ate it in Neal's yard. Oh homeslice, be in edinburgh please?!"

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

Mouth full.Tucked in the somewhat hard to find Neal's Yard, I was so excited to see my favourite pizza food stall go brick and mortar. This is arguably my favourite pizza in London. Now, I know this is a controversial topic, so please don't jump all over me with how much you were disappointed once you tried it based on this review. If you like SUPER crispy pizza, this won't be for you. If you like super 'authentic' (whatever that means), this won't be for you.If you like interesting, if not experimental, toppings, intense and well thought out flavour, doughy, well-salted crust that is crisp on the outside, but delightfully chewy in the centre, this may be for you. You sort of have to fold it in half to eat it. Yes, eat it with your hands.£20 will buy you a massive, 20inch pizza. You can choose two different pizzas and go half and half on the same 'pie' (as they say in America). They also have beer (just one kind?), and wine that they let you pour yourself. They come around with a ruler afterwards to see how much has been drunk and charge you based on that. Their tomato sauce is really nice-- super tangy. Andrew M. and I tried a half artichoke/courgette, half pork belly pizza. I preferred the lemony artichoke and courgette (with a garlic non-tomato base), but both were tasty. Next time, I want to try the basic fresh mozzarella/tomato/basil 'caprese' pizza. a good standard by which to judge pizza ingredients.**UPDATE: The Caprese is delicious too!!!! Possibly my favourite. Straight foward, tangy, and SO fresh tasting."

You can split the toppings if you want, which allows for trying out different toppings at once. Also should you want just a slice you can from their regular pizzas. However at £4 a slice the value isnt great. The pizzas are £20 each, which between 3/4 is totally excellent value, because:THE PIZZAS ARE BLOODY AMAZING!!!!!!Oh my word, garlicy, cripsy and soft, with generous toppings, exotic but balanced. I'm salivating just thinking about this place.Every time i've been its been rammed, regardless of which day of the night it is, so book ahead. Failing that we never had to wait too long for one, and just ate it in Neal's yard. Oh homeslice, be in edinburgh please?!"

They are happy to let you do two different toppings. The crust is delicious! It's a thin pizza with a touch of salt in the crust that is wonderful. I'm still craving this. I will definitely try this on my next pizza I make."

I went twice so far. Last night I ordered a Margherita and I devoured it with my friend. At one point we just looked at each other and said \"it's the olive oil that makes the difference - you can taste it so clearly!\" (referring to both the olive oil in the tomato sauce and the one on the dough). Very satisfactory foodie experience. Their other pizzas are quite tasty and original, too. Everything washed down with a decent lager. Plus, very professional and warm service. I'll stop more often every time I'm in Seven Dials!"

BUT the staff are willing to take your number and give you a call when a table is free, so you don't have to hang around lusting after everyone else's pizza for 40mins, which is a big plus."

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

No pasta, no sides, just pizza. £4/slice or £20 for a 20 inch pizza that's begging to be shared by at least two.Pizza. So what? Why not go to Domino's?Because this is the best pizza in London. Straight out of the pizza oven come almost impossibly thin and crispy pizzas with few ingredients. The margherita is a standout as a direct result of this - the ingredients do the talking. Imagine the best pizza you've had - this is better. I'm a particular fan, somewhat bizarrely, of the crust - it's jam-packed full of flavour.My one gripe with HomeSlice is that it's ever-so-slightly inconsistent. Pizzas can come slightly under- or over-cooked, and with quite significant variations in the amount of toppings - like a distinct dearth of mozzarella on my last visit.Everything I've just said negatively about HomeSlice, however, is entitled and should be ignored. That I'm able to be so bloody picky about pizza in London is quite frankly incredible. But when you've tasted pizza perfection at HomeSlice, continued pursuit of that perfection becomes addictive."

Okay, so four slices for £20 kind of sucks compared to a whole pizza for £20, but when you can only finish two (mind you, they are huge), it's £8 really well spent. Plus, I don't know any other pizza joint in London that does slices (if you do, hit me up!)I feel like you either love it or hate it here. The first time I was like, why is the base so chewy?? I don't understandd.. This is not pizza?!?! And by the fifth slice I think my jaw was a little tired.. How I even ate that much I do not know. But I now know this to be 'real' new york pizza and hey, I like it. So it's sometimes too charred at the bottom and its floppyness gets annoying at times but they really do the best flavours!They used to have this amazing mushroom one with maybe feta and pumpkin seeds with the best balsamic glaze drizzled over. I can't explain it but there's something about the ambitious complexity of flavours that you don't ever expect on pizza. It's so unassuming! I really like mushrooms and have had them foamed, freeze dried and turned into sand at fancy fine dining places but this is my favourite mushroom 'dish' OF ALL TIME. Well, was :( :( :( :( :( (I REALLY AM VERY SAD ABOUT THIS PLEASE BRING IT BACK!)I'd go into more detail about the other varieties but this rambling review is long enough so in short, yes it's crowded and busy and there's a line at any sensible hour but noooooo, just get take away, take the slice out of its little baggie, fold the plate in half and sort of slide the pizza into your mouth as you walk around seven dials.

It definitely was a bit tricky to eat this pizza with no utensils.We opted for a half half of oxtail and salami which set us back 20GBP for a giant 20in pizza. They also offer some pizzas by the slice. The pizza crust was thin and crispy which was great for the first couple of slices but as the minutes ticked by it inevitably got softer and harder to eat. This is where the fork would have come in handy! The oxtail was good but a bit heavy on the horseradish. The salami was yum. Lots of crispy salami pieces topped with rocket!Seating can be a cramped here and it was hard to get in and out as the seats are pretty close together."

Seriously though, the size of the tables is my one gripe about this place.  You have a booth for people to sit in, but the table is maybe only 2/3 the length of the booth.  Weird.But the pizza!  Oh, the pizza!  It's thin crust, which I find to be a necessity.  The pizza is a bit floppy and does require folding for munching, but it takes you back to an American sloppiness without the British politeness of eating pizza with utensils that I love.  We tried four types that evening, but the standout for me was the bone marrow pizza.  The oxtail and horseradish is a great flavor combo, but when I grabbed my slice, all the sauce came careening off, so that was a bit of a bummer.  The menu is super simple, and if you missed it on the board when you walked in, the waitstaff has pictures of it on ipads for you to take a gander.The waitstaff is hipster quirky for sure, but also super friendly and didn't even give us the stinkeye once, despite our closing the place down for the evening.I've already sung the praises of Homeslice to others, so I will hopefully be back soon!"

Mouth full.Tucked in the somewhat hard to find Neal's Yard, I was so excited to see my favourite pizza food stall go brick and mortar. This is arguably my favourite pizza in London. Now, I know this is a controversial topic, so please don't jump all over me with how much you were disappointed once you tried it based on this review. If you like SUPER crispy pizza, this won't be for you. If you like super 'authentic' (whatever that means), this won't be for you.If you like interesting, if not experimental, toppings, intense and well thought out flavour, doughy, well-salted crust that is crisp on the outside, but delightfully chewy in the centre, this may be for you. You sort of have to fold it in half to eat it. Yes, eat it with your hands.£20 will buy you a massive, 20inch pizza. You can choose two different pizzas and go half and half on the same 'pie' (as they say in America). They also have beer (just one kind?), and wine that they let you pour yourself. They come around with a ruler afterwards to see how much has been drunk and charge you based on that. Their tomato sauce is really nice-- super tangy. Andrew M. and I tried a half artichoke/courgette, half pork belly pizza. I preferred the lemony artichoke and courgette (with a garlic non-tomato base), but both were tasty.

The 1st time I stopped here on a Sunday evening around 3 pm and the line was out of the door with crowds milling about. I ran away.Went back at what I thought was an odd time (Monday afternoon 2 pm) and it was still packed but I managed to get a small spot to sit in after a 10 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

It is a colorful and enchanting little court yard just up the road from Covent Garden filled with a few other restaurants and little shops. When I came here, there was a two hour wait time for a table. This place gets filled up quick so if you're planning on going with a group, make sure you have a reservation or go super early. Thankfully, for those eager to try it out they do offer take away by the slice. Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4£ per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!"

The not being able to reserve a table although annoying is made up for by the fact you can put your mobile number down and go for a drink, as they call you. Generally speaking the time estimate they give you is normally accurate, my most recent visit we did end up waiting a little longer, the bonus of this though was finding a little restaurant Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Neal's Yard that let us just order wine so will definitely head there in future. I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

They also often have a lovely courgette pizza with a white base. Everything is delicious and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend."

Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

After a somewhat boring hour of listening to a not so interesting professor she asked me whether I like pizza. Duh. Who does not like a good pizza? \"We ought to go to Neal's Yard\" she said. \"You will love it.\" So we walked.This was my first of frequent visits. My first ever slice was as she predicted loved and I took my self appointed task of introducing the place to numerous friends very seriously. After a geocache adventure we ended up in Homeslice and I converted two friends. After another mystery, namely the core exam of my degree, we had to celebrate our survival with three pizzas and when my siblings visited me in lovely London I knew where to go as well. Homeslice has never disappointed me. I particularly like the goat's shoulder and savoy cabbage pizza, but would recommend any really. I like the cosy setup of the restaurant. Simple wooden tables and a good view on the burning wood oven. This is a true gem in the middle of the crowded West End."

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

It is a colorful and enchanting little court yard just up the road from Covent Garden filled with a few other restaurants and little shops. When I came here, there was a two hour wait time for a table. This place gets filled up quick so if you're planning on going with a group, make sure you have a reservation or go super early. Thankfully, for those eager to try it out they do offer take away by the slice. Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4£ per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!"

The not being able to reserve a table although annoying is made up for by the fact you can put your mobile number down and go for a drink, as they call you. Generally speaking the time estimate they give you is normally accurate, my most recent visit we did end up waiting a little longer, the bonus of this though was finding a little restaurant Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Neal's Yard that let us just order wine so will definitely head there in future. I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride."

Simple wooden tables and a good view on the burning wood oven. This is a true gem in the middle of the crowded West End."

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride."

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

The not being able to reserve a table although annoying is made up for by the fact you can put your mobile number down and go for a drink, as they call you. Generally speaking the time estimate they give you is normally accurate, my most recent visit we did end up waiting a little longer, the bonus of this though was finding a little restaurant Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Neal's Yard that let us just order wine so will definitely head there in future. I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket.

I love the simplistic pricing and all the choices and combinations you can have for pizza.Me and my boyfriend were very hungry and decided to demolish one pizza between the two of us (which I personally think is impressive!) the 20\" pizza could probably feed 3 moderately hungry guests, especially if you wanted drinks etc.We ordered our pizza with half goat shoulder and kale and half classic margarita. It is a struggle for me to decide which one is better! The goat shoulder was very tender and flavourful. It tasted well balanced with kale leaves on the pizza. The tomato sauce on the margarita half tasted very fresh and slightly sweet. I do wish we had more basil on the margarita end though. Perhaps that is something we could request next time...The location is really cute, right inside neal's yard. Warning that this place can get very full quickly! And they don't take bookings.

After a somewhat boring hour of listening to a not so interesting professor she asked me whether I like pizza. Duh. Who does not like a good pizza? \"We ought to go to Neal's Yard\" she said. \"You will love it.\" So we walked.This was my first of frequent visits. My first ever slice was as she predicted loved and I took my self appointed task of introducing the place to numerous friends very seriously. After a geocache adventure we ended up in Homeslice and I converted two friends. After another mystery, namely the core exam of my degree, we had to celebrate our survival with three pizzas and when my siblings visited me in lovely London I knew where to go as well. Homeslice has never disappointed me. I particularly like the goat's shoulder and savoy cabbage pizza, but would recommend any really. I like the cosy setup of the restaurant. Simple wooden tables and a good view on the burning wood oven. This is a true gem in the middle of the crowded West End."

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride."

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

It is a colorful and enchanting little court yard just up the road from Covent Garden filled with a few other restaurants and little shops. When I came here, there was a two hour wait time for a table. This place gets filled up quick so if you're planning on going with a group, make sure you have a reservation or go super early. Thankfully, for those eager to try it out they do offer take away by the slice. Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4£ per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!"

I love the simplistic pricing and all the choices and combinations you can have for pizza.Me and my boyfriend were very hungry and decided to demolish one pizza between the two of us (which I personally think is impressive!) the 20\" pizza could probably feed 3 moderately hungry guests, especially if you wanted drinks etc.We ordered our pizza with half goat shoulder and kale and half classic margarita. It is a struggle for me to decide which one is better! The goat shoulder was very tender and flavourful. It tasted well balanced with kale leaves on the pizza. The tomato sauce on the margarita half tasted very fresh and slightly sweet. I do wish we had more basil on the margarita end though. Perhaps that is something we could request next time...The location is really cute, right inside neal's yard. Warning that this place can get very full quickly! And they don't take bookings.

When I came here, there was a two hour wait time for a table. This place gets filled up quick so if you're planning on going with a group, make sure you have a reservation or go super early. Thankfully, for those eager to try it out they do offer take away by the slice. Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4£ per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!"

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first!

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

The not being able to reserve a table although annoying is made up for by the fact you can put your mobile number down and go for a drink, as they call you. Generally speaking the time estimate they give you is normally accurate, my most recent visit we did end up waiting a little longer, the bonus of this though was finding a little restaurant Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Neal's Yard that let us just order wine so will definitely head there in future. I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

But trust me, nowhere in London will you find pizza this incredible. Everything is tasty. My personal favourite is their chorizo, corn and coriander pizza (trust me, it just works). They also often have a lovely courgette pizza with a white base. Everything is delicious and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend."

The 1st time I stopped here on a Sunday evening around 3 pm and the line was out of the door with crowds milling about. I ran away.Went back at what I thought was an odd time (Monday afternoon 2 pm) and it was still packed but I managed to get a small spot to sit in after a 10 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

I also love that they are different by serving the pizza, and also the wine, in over-size. You don't order by glass but will have a 2-litre bottle on the table which will be measured at the end. Possibly dangerous but above all just fun.Unfortunately the deliciousness of Homeslice Pizza is not a secret so you will have to queue if you want a table. If possible, go before dinner time and it will be less crowded."

Time it smart (off-peak) or be prepared for a short wait or the classic leave-number-they'll-call move.Basic model: - several pizzas are by-the-sliceFor the most part, though, you're \"stuck\" (not a bad problem to have) with - the one size pie (20 inches) which, thankfully, you can get 1/2 and 1/220GBP for some delicious combinations- eggplant and harissa on a cauliflower cheese base- salami and rocket- goat shoulder and sumac yogurt- corn, chorizo and spring onion It's delicious.  Add some chili oil (or don't), enjoy the salty thin crust with just the right give...and tuck into your fair share of the pie.  Go geddit girl.  Yelp note: PROSECCO ON TAP!!!!  Double Yelp note: 2nd location opening in Fitzrovia soon!"

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

We ordered a 20\" half and half (one half:chorizo, coriander and corn, second half: ricotta, mushroom and chilli) and I couldn't help but gasp in awe when it hovered above our heads and served to our table. The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion). They also provided us with a pizza cutter (which always a plus in my books), which provided me with great entertainment as I watched my friends attempting to equally divide this gigantic creation!!"

It's enough to say, the pizza here is Amazing. You either buy slices (£4) or share a large pizza for £20. Definitely doable for two people, or perfect to share between 3. We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever. Still, I don't feel we missed out on my first visit here.It can be busy at lunch time, but the wait was only 20 min. They take your number so you can walk around covent garden and before you know it your table is ready. Definitely worth the wait!"

Gourmet ingredients.Staff is very friendly and master at managing the masses storming the gates (and they are always storming the gates.)The place itself is chill and fun. Long, shared tables (count on a quasi-public conversation and the occasional bumped elbows), but everyone is jovial and having fun.First time I discovered this place, I ate there three times that first week. Now I have to force myself to only go twice (for my waistline) as Homeslice is just...that...good."

We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever. Still, I don't feel we missed out on my first visit here.It can be busy at lunch time, but the wait was only 20 min.

Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend.

I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal."

Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states.

I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try.

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

For flavourful, amazing pizza, there is just no place better.They bring out gigantic 20\" pizzas and hand you a pizza cutter, at which point everyone gets stuck in! At 20 pounds a pizza I think it's very reasonable.I especially like the Corn, Chorizo, & Coriander Pizza. I'm also a huge fan of their Cauliflower Cheese Pizza (it's got some sort of venison sausage on it as well), and the Lamb Shoulder, Watercress, Tomato, Red-Wine-Soaked Goat Cheese. Pro tip: This place gets incredibly packed. Ideally, you should only come with one other person, thus minimizing your wait time. Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend. Luckily, Neal's Yard is a really cool area and there are a lot of shops/pubs to explore nearby while you wait."

All were good but none were great. Too little sauce on some. Too little cheese on others. Most of the toppings seemed to be just tossed onto a regular slice that was warned up for a minute or two. Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices."

I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal."

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

Add to that that they serve basically the best pizza I've ever eaten and they've avoided my ire entirely.With an ever-changing menu a return trip can be a little heart-wrenching (oh, Lincolnshire poacher how could you desert me?) but their menu options are always amazing and original (mint pesto? sure, why not?). The 20inch half and half is definitely the way to go and I've, so far, never been disappointed.I'm also overly fond of the giant wine bottles that they then measure to work out your bill; but that's primarily because that, paired with a giant pizza, means I can pretend to be a borrower. Always a good time.I've been here a few times now and will no doubt be back again. I just hope that they manage to open a larger version at some point - it is sometimes nice not to eat with a stranger's elbow in your side..."

For flavourful, amazing pizza, there is just no place better.They bring out gigantic 20\" pizzas and hand you a pizza cutter, at which point everyone gets stuck in! At 20 pounds a pizza I think it's very reasonable.I especially like the Corn, Chorizo, & Coriander Pizza. I'm also a huge fan of their Cauliflower Cheese Pizza (it's got some sort of venison sausage on it as well), and the Lamb Shoulder, Watercress, Tomato, Red-Wine-Soaked Goat Cheese. Pro tip: This place gets incredibly packed. Ideally, you should only come with one other person, thus minimizing your wait time. Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend. Luckily, Neal's Yard is a really cool area and there are a lot of shops/pubs to explore nearby while you wait."

All were good but none were great. Too little sauce on some. Too little cheese on others. Most of the toppings seemed to be just tossed onto a regular slice that was warned up for a minute or two. Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices."

I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try.

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please.

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven.

We ordered a 20\" half and half (one half:chorizo, coriander and corn, second half: ricotta, mushroom and chilli) and I couldn't help but gasp in awe when it hovered above our heads and served to our table. The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion).

We were told it would be 30 minutes and turned up a little late, this was lucky as the table wasnt yet ready. When it was ready turned out they thought we said 3 people, to there credit they quickly sourced another table for three but in a different paet of the restaurant...... after a little chat with some other patrons we managed to get a table altogether. They have a good selection of beers and we had a cracking meal. The waitress was helpful with suggestions and also joined in on the lad banter that was going on.

We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever. Still, I don't feel we missed out on my first visit here.It can be busy at lunch time, but the wait was only 20 min.

The seating was also highly in demand so you can tell how popular this place is. It is rightly so a hidden gem that is not given enough credit.

They take your number so you can walk around covent garden and before you know it your table is ready. Definitely worth the wait!"

After dinner there, I was told that this was his best date ever and I think it may be because of this place. The atmosphere was buzzing and the music was spot on to my taste. The seating was also highly in demand so you can tell how popular this place is. It is rightly so a hidden gem that is not given enough credit. I have friends in NYC who have family that own a stone-baked pizza company and I mentioned this place. I told them that they have competition trans Atlantic. Haha!"

But difinetly the 'Pizza' is good. Though I am a vegan; ( no animal by-products) a Culinary study at a California Chef Vegan school would greatly enhance your costumers smile's.

Long, shared tables (count on a quasi-public conversation and the occasional bumped elbows), but everyone is jovial and having fun.First time I discovered this place, I ate there three times that first week.

For flavourful, amazing pizza, there is just no place better.They bring out gigantic 20\" pizzas and hand you a pizza cutter, at which point everyone gets stuck in! At 20 pounds a pizza I think it's very reasonable.I especially like the Corn, Chorizo, & Coriander Pizza. I'm also a huge fan of their Cauliflower Cheese Pizza (it's got some sort of venison sausage on it as well), and the Lamb Shoulder, Watercress, Tomato, Red-Wine-Soaked Goat Cheese. Pro tip: This place gets incredibly packed. Ideally, you should only come with one other person, thus minimizing your wait time. Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend. Luckily, Neal's Yard is a really cool area and there are a lot of shops/pubs to explore nearby while you wait."

All were good but none were great. Too little sauce on some. Too little cheese on others. Most of the toppings seemed to be just tossed onto a regular slice that was warned up for a minute or two. Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices."

I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal."

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

There was a nice smell pervading the small restaurant space in Neal's Yard when I arrived but as there's a no booking policy, our group faced a 45 minute wait on arrival. However, what was a bit off-putting was that my friend and I were given the hint twice to go away despite there being  more than enough room in the restaurant to wait. Then, no sooner had we sat down in a nearby coffeeshop when we were then summoned back as our table was ready.The small space is compact with stools and low tables but they have been clever with providing things like hooks for coats. Be prepared to share tables. The menu of pizza is up on the wall with old classics mixed with some innovative combos - all pizzas are £20 and you can mix 2 flavours on one pizza. They have an innovative way of selling wine in a large bottle and you're charged by them measuring the amount remaining in the bottle. The music was too loud with conversation taking place with uncomfortable shouting across the tableBut the food, the food, I hear you cry. Well, I did like the toppings with the butternut, bacon, stichelton and smoked onion being my favourite combo. However, the base didn't impress me - it was soft, making it hard to cut with the blunt pizza cutter. The middle of the pizza was too floppy, making eating the pizza very messy as fillings kept falling off. The edge was too doughy and most of our group left our crusts. I like my pizza bases more crispySorry, Homeslice but I can't really add my glowing love for you"

The 20inch half and half is definitely the way to go and I've, so far, never been disappointed.I'm also overly fond of the giant wine bottles that they then measure to work out your bill; but that's primarily because that, paired with a giant pizza, means I can pretend to be a borrower. Always a good time.I've been here a few times now and will no doubt be back again.

Well worth giving it a try if you're in the area."

We ordered a 20\" half and half (one half:chorizo, coriander and corn, second half: ricotta, mushroom and chilli) and I couldn't help but gasp in awe when it hovered above our heads and served to our table. The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion). They also provided us with a pizza cutter (which always a plus in my books), which provided me with great entertainment as I watched my friends attempting to equally divide this gigantic creation!!"

We were told it would be 30 minutes and turned up a little late, this was lucky as the table wasnt yet ready. When it was ready turned out they thought we said 3 people, to there credit they quickly sourced another table for three but in a different paet of the restaurant...... after a little chat with some other patrons we managed to get a table altogether. They have a good selection of beers and we had a cracking meal. The waitress was helpful with suggestions and also joined in on the lad banter that was going on. My one concern with this place is its very small and if you turn up at the wrong time you may just have to go hungry. :-("

It's simple really: lovely ingredients, good service, good location, good price to portion/quality, creative pizza concoctions. Like I could do this, right? Pfft ... nah I'll leave it to the experts. But maybe I'll build a brick oven in my backyard, cause I can't go back non-wood fired pizza. I just can't."

The rest need to be bought as a £20 pizza - its recommended you share these and the restaurant will happily make them half one topping and half another.Positives:+ Pizzas (I tried 2) were really tasty, we finished all of our pizza easily.+ There are also some imaginative options (e.g. the cauliflower cheese pizza)+ Service was quick+ Decent value for moneyOn the other hand:- Limited tables for groups of 6+- Most choices require you to buy the 20\" pizza for £20 so not great unless you're at least 2 people, really hungry (I reckon I could eat a whole one myself if necessary, they're quite thin) or happy to take leftovers home- Our crusts were very salty, I liked the taste but that much salt must be v bad...Overall: We've become very picky about our Friday lunches as spoilt for choice around Covent Garden but we agreed unanimously that we'll come back here. Well worth giving it a try if you're in the area."

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!"

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great.

The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

After asking to be moved to the front I was looking forward to the sparkling stuff on tap only to be told they had run out.The menu is my type of menu only 8 items 4 of which you could have by the slice.We went for a half and half 20 inch Margarita and half bone marrow.The pizza come on a wooden board with slicer ready for you to divi up to your partyIt was truly amazing the bone marrow half was meaty and moorish and the margarita reminded me of a New York pizza Yummy!Seek out home slice you wont be disappointed!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!"

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless.

Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!"

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

I SAID...BRING ME THE HOMESLICE.  BRING IT NOW! NOW! NOW! ARRRRRRGGHHHH!"

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great.

The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

        "comments": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!"

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it.

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless.

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

After asking to be moved to the front I was looking forward to the sparkling stuff on tap only to be told they had run out.The menu is my type of menu only 8 items 4 of which you could have by the slice.We went for a half and half 20 inch Margarita and half bone marrow.The pizza come on a wooden board with slicer ready for you to divi up to your partyIt was truly amazing the bone marrow half was meaty and moorish and the margarita reminded me of a New York pizza Yummy!Seek out home slice you wont be disappointed!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

I SAID...BRING ME THE HOMESLICE.  BRING IT NOW! NOW! NOW! ARRRRRRGGHHHH!"

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great.

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

What massive idiots.  Just round the corner is stunning wood fired pizza slices.  I only had margarita, it was full of flavour, with a charred base that tasted slightly sweet.  You eat this New York style, folded up on a paper plate.  The chilli oil in the skull is a not quite as scary as it looks, actually is tasty.  The beer is cold and goes perfectly. Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

        "comments": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it.

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

I SAID...BRING ME THE HOMESLICE.  BRING IT NOW! NOW! NOW! ARRRRRRGGHHHH!"

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

The only difficulty was that we couldn't choose which pizza to get, so we just got a half and half. I'll definitely be back to try the rest or whatever they come up with next.And I'll add the corn/chorizo combo to my own cooking at home. Thanks."

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

After asking to be moved to the front I was looking forward to the sparkling stuff on tap only to be told they had run out.The menu is my type of menu only 8 items 4 of which you could have by the slice.We went for a half and half 20 inch Margarita and half bone marrow.The pizza come on a wooden board with slicer ready for you to divi up to your partyIt was truly amazing the bone marrow half was meaty and moorish and the margarita reminded me of a New York pizza Yummy!Seek out home slice you wont be disappointed!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

What massive idiots.  Just round the corner is stunning wood fired pizza slices.  I only had margarita, it was full of flavour, with a charred base that tasted slightly sweet.  You eat this New York style, folded up on a paper plate.  The chilli oil in the skull is a not quite as scary as it looks, actually is tasty.  The beer is cold and goes perfectly. Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

        "comments": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!"

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed.

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless.

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

I SAID...BRING ME THE HOMESLICE.  BRING IT NOW! NOW! NOW! ARRRRRRGGHHHH!"

The only difficulty was that we couldn't choose which pizza to get, so we just got a half and half. I'll definitely be back to try the rest or whatever they come up with next.And I'll add the corn/chorizo combo to my own cooking at home. Thanks."

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

        "comments": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!"

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

After asking to be moved to the front I was looking forward to the sparkling stuff on tap only to be told they had run out.The menu is my type of menu only 8 items 4 of which you could have by the slice.We went for a half and half 20 inch Margarita and half bone marrow.The pizza come on a wooden board with slicer ready for you to divi up to your partyIt was truly amazing the bone marrow half was meaty and moorish and the margarita reminded me of a New York pizza Yummy!Seek out home slice you wont be disappointed!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables.

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

After asking to be moved to the front I was looking forward to the sparkling stuff on tap only to be told they had run out.The menu is my type of menu only 8 items 4 of which you could have by the slice.We went for a half and half 20 inch Margarita and half bone marrow.The pizza come on a wooden board with slicer ready for you to divi up to your partyIt was truly amazing the bone marrow half was meaty and moorish and the margarita reminded me of a New York pizza Yummy!Seek out home slice you wont be disappointed!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

What massive idiots.  Just round the corner is stunning wood fired pizza slices.  I only had margarita, it was full of flavour, with a charred base that tasted slightly sweet.  You eat this New York style, folded up on a paper plate.  The chilli oil in the skull is a not quite as scary as it looks, actually is tasty.  The beer is cold and goes perfectly. Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

        "comments": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!"

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

I SAID...BRING ME THE HOMESLICE.  BRING IT NOW! NOW! NOW! ARRRRRRGGHHHH!"

No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great.

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice.

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great.

The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

        "comments": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

We had the half salami/ rocket & half mushroom, ricotta & pumpkin seeds (SOOOO DELICIOUS!!), and half scallop, garlic and pancetta, half lamb shoulder and goats cheese (even better!!!) .

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!"

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

I SAID...BRING ME THE HOMESLICE.  BRING IT NOW! NOW! NOW! ARRRRRRGGHHHH!"

She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

        "comments": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

I was waiting for the rest of my party to arrive before they seated me and the man was very welcoming and trying to make sure even though they were busy, they could accommodate us right away when everyone got there. It is a small place and gets busy because its delicious, so you might have to wait. They have slices to take away as well. We had the half salami/ rocket & half mushroom, ricotta & pumpkin seeds (SOOOO DELICIOUS!!), and half scallop, garlic and pancetta, half lamb shoulder and goats cheese (even better!!!) . I cannot recommend this place enough if you want a fun girls night out or a great date night."

Neil's Yard is so charming and the food, beer, and wine at Homeslice were a perfect addition to that charm. The pizzas \"look\" huge, but are very thinly made ~ so you eat more than you think (and still have some to take home). We had half caprese, half asparagus/ricotta/pepper. We loved it and highly recommend!!!"

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu. The place does get pretty full, so try to come at a time you think it will be less crowded."

Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious.

They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu.

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

I usually don't like eating in public, especially when there is so many people looking at me. My room mates ordered for home the biggest pizza I have seen. Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza. The only waiting you have to do is while the pretty baked good comes to you, as often there is a crowd of hungry people who are also waiting."

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around £44 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends. Also note that this place is particularly busy so it does get really loud. This doesn't diminish the excellent service that we had. I would come back again!"

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu. The place does get pretty full, so try to come at a time you think it will be less crowded."

Only slightly more private though as they crammed in to close to each other that the couple next to us had to move their table about a foot for me to get through the gap! The vibe is cool here though and it reminded me a lot of some of the pizza joints in New York, with the pizza taking up most of the table, no cutlery and paper plates.Our good friend Kirsty was with us this evening so we ordered a few a Camden Hells Lager each and got down to choosing our toppings. Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime. I'm very keen to go back and their interesting, exciting toppings certainly help them stand apart from the competition."

Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours.

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu. The place does get pretty full, so try to come at a time you think it will be less crowded."

The vibe is cool here though and it reminded me a lot of some of the pizza joints in New York, with the pizza taking up most of the table, no cutlery and paper plates.Our good friend Kirsty was with us this evening so we ordered a few a Camden Hells Lager each and got down to choosing our toppings. Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime. I'm very keen to go back and their interesting, exciting toppings certainly help them stand apart from the competition."

And this would be the song: When the mooooon hits your eye like a biig pizza pie, it's amoooreee....I'm not a pizza person, but Homeslice is a yummy exception I am happy to make. Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy. I appreciate that they offer the choice of flavours with tomato sauce and others with white sauce."

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza. The only waiting you have to do is while the pretty baked good comes to you, as often there is a crowd of hungry people who are also waiting."

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old).

The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were.

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around £44 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends. Also note that this place is particularly busy so it does get really loud. This doesn't diminish the excellent service that we had. I would come back again!"

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

The waitresses are not-in-your-face cool, maneuvering around the many little tables with giant pizzas and a good attitude.The restaurant is filled with 20somethings, primarily in groups of 2, shouting at each other over jaw-droppingly/conversation-startingy large pizzas with unlikely toppings. The fairly small room is quickly filled with the impressive pizza oven, the cooks throwing their dough in the air, the waiters' explanations of how this all works, the loud music and all the chatter. You get one giant 20 inch pizza for £20 which you can split in half by topping. There are 10 choices only written on a chalkboard, because menus are so 2014.We went for the classic salami, rocket and parmesan, with mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds and chili flakes (but, were vey tempted by the goat shoulder with red kale and sumac yoghurt!). Pizzas arrived quickly and were eaten off paper plates - who needs table space for plates when you have a giant pizza? You get your own pizza slicer, which in our case led to some irregularly sized slices... Sharing napkins and condiments between tables is encouraged and adds to the warm buzz of the place.The dough was thin, the crust was soft, the toppings are very well put together. The ricotta was so fresh, the salami wasn't greasy - you can almost pretend you're eating healthily. The chili flakes and pumpkin seeds gave the pizza a kick without making it too alien. I found the bottom of the pizza a little smokier than I would have preferred, but devoured all the crust, because it was incredible. Generally, one of the best pizzas in London.We went at 10pm and there was no queue, but larger groups behind us couldn't find an available table anymore. Definitely worth a try in a small group at an awkward hour!USP: Giant sharing pizzas, good price, gourmet toppings, (cool name).Go with: Somebody you don't mind shouting at, that can both share and eat. I'd say bff, sibling, fourth date.Price: Low - £10 will fill you up!Comparison: Similar style to Franco Manca in terms of interesting toppings, dough was more similar to Pizza Pilgrims, but major wins on size of pizza for price, and collaborative atmosphere."

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around £44 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends. Also note that this place is particularly busy so it does get really loud. This doesn't diminish the excellent service that we had. I would come back again!"

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu. The place does get pretty full, so try to come at a time you think it will be less crowded."

Only slightly more private though as they crammed in to close to each other that the couple next to us had to move their table about a foot for me to get through the gap! The vibe is cool here though and it reminded me a lot of some of the pizza joints in New York, with the pizza taking up most of the table, no cutlery and paper plates.Our good friend Kirsty was with us this evening so we ordered a few a Camden Hells Lager each and got down to choosing our toppings. Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime. I'm very keen to go back and their interesting, exciting toppings certainly help them stand apart from the competition."

And this would be the song: When the mooooon hits your eye like a biig pizza pie, it's amoooreee....I'm not a pizza person, but Homeslice is a yummy exception I am happy to make. Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy. I appreciate that they offer the choice of flavours with tomato sauce and others with white sauce."

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

I usually don't like eating in public, especially when there is so many people looking at me. My room mates ordered for home the biggest pizza I have seen. Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza. The only waiting you have to do is while the pretty baked good comes to you, as often there is a crowd of hungry people who are also waiting."

Very fresh tasting with bold exciting flavours.The sumac yoghurt was a tad too liberally applied so overpowered the rest of the toppings but nonetheless was truly great.The real showstopper was the BBQ brisket which was an inspired choice.These pizza's are huge so one can be comfortably shared by two people unless you feel brave and go for one each (I did and had LOTS of leftovers).Drink selection was limited but they offered me a Brixton beer which is now a new fave.Win win."

Whty do they have to close the kitchen at 20 on Sunday?!?! I mean there is really no reason for doing it, why should I have a pizza at midday? Just pay the damn pizza man a little bit more and make him work on sunday night, damn it!Anyway, we finally managed to come in at 19:55 and still be able to order two pizzas in three. If you are hungry, you can go for one each (Don't listen to Rob, he's just inventing as he probably ate three pizzas alone). Now, the list of pizzas is constantly changing, and that's a very good thing, as they usually have something strange among them, last time was haggis. Yes, Haggis!! and it was damn good!The pizza itself: as everybody else is saying, it's on a 20\" massive thing with one or two topping styles on it, you slice it (I love to slice pizzas!) and you eat it! The pizza is of course thin, as a 20\" Naples pizza would fill an elephant after half of it, but they are really good in not letting it become too wet in the middle, and the result is that the pizza is good both on the sides and at the center, not that easy to find, compliments to the guy who built their oven as he really know how to do his job!Other than the haggis, however, the ingredients are not that good. I mean, they are not bad, but Pilgrims is light-years far from it. Still, I loved this place, especially for us, eating pizza almost once per week, it's nice sometimes to change place, and I will surely come back to this place sooner. AND I'd love to see the damn kitchen open till 22 on Sunday. Damn."

Once I'd hidden in the corner for a while.The décor is nice and I think 'nice' is the best word for it. Some school-esque coat hooks on the walls, church pew benches, couple of faux vintage mirrors, the odd chalk menu board. But it does have lovely high ceilings, so there's a very welcome sense of space - it feels relaxed, which is always good for pizza place.Homeslice does 20\" pizzas (which I'll definitely try on my own at some point - challenge accepted.) but my girlfriend and I have a couple of the £4 single slices with some of the on-tap frizzante wine. The big pizzas have some 'interesting combinations, with two in particular catching my eye for future reference: Haggis, leek & ogleshield (apparently it's a kind of cheese) and pulled pork, mint & walnut pesto.But the slices we went for, and what we thought of them, were:-    Courgette and artichoke, with a white sauce base - the garlic of the white sauce pretty much overpowered the others flavours, but I like garlic, so I really enjoyed it-    Salami and rocket, on a tomato base - very nice. Tasty and fresh. A solid thin-crust pizza, but perhaps a little light on ingredients.The frizzante was good - light, sweet, and went perfectly with the pizza. And the glass was full to the top. Vital!Overall, I actually really like Homeslice. A fairly vanilla setting, but it's so nice to be somewhere that feels light and spacious for once. The food? Tasty and pretty reasonably priced. The service? That's something that Homeslice does really well. Polite, friendly, helpful, and efficient throughout, and service wasn't added to the bill automatically - a small but nice change. Plus, we were automatically given a bottle of tap water as soon as we sat down. Civilised.I've used words like 'nice' in this review, that's exactly what I'll want every so often, and Homeslice delivers."

I don't know if its the best pizza I have ever had, its good and the novelty 20\" size (two toping choice possible) is a great idea but to be honest it was a little bit floppy when cut. - a few people complain the cutters are blunt, and yeah they are but they get the job done!We turned up on a friday evening and had to put our name down for a table of 6. We were told it would be 30 minutes and turned up a little late, this was lucky as the table wasnt yet ready. When it was ready turned out they thought we said 3 people, to there credit they quickly sourced another table for three but in a different paet of the restaurant...... after a little chat with some other patrons we managed to get a table altogether. They have a good selection of beers and we had a cracking meal. The waitress was helpful with suggestions and also joined in on the lad banter that was going on. My one concern with this place is its very small and if you turn up at the wrong time you may just have to go hungry. :-("

We ordered a 20\" half and half (one half:chorizo, coriander and corn, second half: ricotta, mushroom and chilli) and I couldn't help but gasp in awe when it hovered above our heads and served to our table. The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion). They also provided us with a pizza cutter (which always a plus in my books), which provided me with great entertainment as I watched my friends attempting to equally divide this gigantic creation!!"

I don't know if its the best pizza I have ever had, its good and the novelty 20\" size (two toping choice possible) is a great idea but to be honest it was a little bit floppy when cut. - a few people complain the cutters are blunt, and yeah they are but they get the job done!We turned up on a friday evening and had to put our name down for a table of 6. We were told it would be 30 minutes and turned up a little late, this was lucky as the table wasnt yet ready. When it was ready turned out they thought we said 3 people, to there credit they quickly sourced another table for three but in a different paet of the restaurant...... after a little chat with some other patrons we managed to get a table altogether. They have a good selection of beers and we had a cracking meal. The waitress was helpful with suggestions and also joined in on the lad banter that was going on. My one concern with this place is its very small and if you turn up at the wrong time you may just have to go hungry. :-("

It's enough to say, the pizza here is Amazing. You either buy slices (£4) or share a large pizza for £20. Definitely doable for two people, or perfect to share between 3. We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever. Still, I don't feel we missed out on my first visit here.It can be busy at lunch time, but the wait was only 20 min. They take your number so you can walk around covent garden and before you know it your table is ready. Definitely worth the wait!"

Gourmet ingredients.Staff is very friendly and master at managing the masses storming the gates (and they are always storming the gates.)The place itself is chill and fun. Long, shared tables (count on a quasi-public conversation and the occasional bumped elbows), but everyone is jovial and having fun.First time I discovered this place, I ate there three times that first week. Now I have to force myself to only go twice (for my waistline) as Homeslice is just...that...good."

It's enough to say, the pizza here is Amazing. You either buy slices (£4) or share a large pizza for £20. Definitely doable for two people, or perfect to share between 3. We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever. Still, I don't feel we missed out on my first visit here.It can be busy at lunch time, but the wait was only 20 min. They take your number so you can walk around covent garden and before you know it your table is ready. Definitely worth the wait!"

I'm also a huge fan of their Cauliflower Cheese Pizza (it's got some sort of venison sausage on it as well), and the Lamb Shoulder, Watercress, Tomato, Red-Wine-Soaked Goat Cheese. Pro tip: This place gets incredibly packed. Ideally, you should only come with one other person, thus minimizing your wait time. Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend.

Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices."

        "comments": "There's little for me to add to all those who have waxed lyrical about the incredible Pizza at homeslice. I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal."

So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try.

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal."

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

All were good but none were great. Too little sauce on some. Too little cheese on others. Most of the toppings seemed to be just tossed onto a regular slice that was warned up for a minute or two. Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices."

Add to that that they serve basically the best pizza I've ever eaten and they've avoided my ire entirely.With an ever-changing menu a return trip can be a little heart-wrenching (oh, Lincolnshire poacher how could you desert me?) but their menu options are always amazing and original (mint pesto? sure, why not?). The 20inch half and half is definitely the way to go and I've, so far, never been disappointed.I'm also overly fond of the giant wine bottles that they then measure to work out your bill; but that's primarily because that, paired with a giant pizza, means I can pretend to be a borrower. Always a good time.I've been here a few times now and will no doubt be back again. I just hope that they manage to open a larger version at some point - it is sometimes nice not to eat with a stranger's elbow in your side..."

I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try.

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please.

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion).

We were told it would be 30 minutes and turned up a little late, this was lucky as the table wasnt yet ready. When it was ready turned out they thought we said 3 people, to there credit they quickly sourced another table for three but in a different paet of the restaurant...... after a little chat with some other patrons we managed to get a table altogether. They have a good selection of beers and we had a cracking meal. The waitress was helpful with suggestions and also joined in on the lad banter that was going on.

We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever. Still, I don't feel we missed out on my first visit here.It can be busy at lunch time, but the wait was only 20 min.

But difinetly the 'Pizza' is good. Though I am a vegan; ( no animal by-products) a Culinary study at a California Chef Vegan school would greatly enhance your costumers smile's. The uninformed about 'vegan' foods is a bit less than one imagines....Sooooooo advertise the 'ingriedents' promotely with a 'simple' type writer size sheet of paper upon the entrance doors window...or where the menu is located outside on the window of your 'dining establishment.    Success.

Gourmet ingredients.Staff is very friendly and master at managing the masses storming the gates (and they are always storming the gates.)The place itself is chill and fun. Long, shared tables (count on a quasi-public conversation and the occasional bumped elbows), but everyone is jovial and having fun.First time I discovered this place, I ate there three times that first week. Now I have to force myself to only go twice (for my waistline) as Homeslice is just...that...good."

For flavourful, amazing pizza, there is just no place better.They bring out gigantic 20\" pizzas and hand you a pizza cutter, at which point everyone gets stuck in! At 20 pounds a pizza I think it's very reasonable.I especially like the Corn, Chorizo, & Coriander Pizza. I'm also a huge fan of their Cauliflower Cheese Pizza (it's got some sort of venison sausage on it as well), and the Lamb Shoulder, Watercress, Tomato, Red-Wine-Soaked Goat Cheese. Pro tip: This place gets incredibly packed. Ideally, you should only come with one other person, thus minimizing your wait time. Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend. Luckily, Neal's Yard is a really cool area and there are a lot of shops/pubs to explore nearby while you wait."

But difinetly the 'Pizza' is good. Though I am a vegan; ( no animal by-products) a Culinary study at a California Chef Vegan school would greatly enhance your costumers smile's. The uninformed about 'vegan' foods is a bit less than one imagines....Sooooooo advertise the 'ingriedents' promotely with a 'simple' type writer size sheet of paper upon the entrance doors window...or where the menu is located outside on the window of your 'dining establishment.    Success.

Gourmet ingredients.Staff is very friendly and master at managing the masses storming the gates (and they are always storming the gates.)The place itself is chill and fun. Long, shared tables (count on a quasi-public conversation and the occasional bumped elbows), but everyone is jovial and having fun.First time I discovered this place, I ate there three times that first week. Now I have to force myself to only go twice (for my waistline) as Homeslice is just...that...good."

For flavourful, amazing pizza, there is just no place better.They bring out gigantic 20\" pizzas and hand you a pizza cutter, at which point everyone gets stuck in! At 20 pounds a pizza I think it's very reasonable.I especially like the Corn, Chorizo, & Coriander Pizza. I'm also a huge fan of their Cauliflower Cheese Pizza (it's got some sort of venison sausage on it as well), and the Lamb Shoulder, Watercress, Tomato, Red-Wine-Soaked Goat Cheese. Pro tip: This place gets incredibly packed. Ideally, you should only come with one other person, thus minimizing your wait time. Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend. Luckily, Neal's Yard is a really cool area and there are a lot of shops/pubs to explore nearby while you wait."

All were good but none were great. Too little sauce on some. Too little cheese on others. Most of the toppings seemed to be just tossed onto a regular slice that was warned up for a minute or two. Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices."

I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal."

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

There was a nice smell pervading the small restaurant space in Neal's Yard when I arrived but as there's a no booking policy, our group faced a 45 minute wait on arrival. However, what was a bit off-putting was that my friend and I were given the hint twice to go away despite there being  more than enough room in the restaurant to wait. Then, no sooner had we sat down in a nearby coffeeshop when we were then summoned back as our table was ready.The small space is compact with stools and low tables but they have been clever with providing things like hooks for coats. Be prepared to share tables. The menu of pizza is up on the wall with old classics mixed with some innovative combos - all pizzas are £20 and you can mix 2 flavours on one pizza. They have an innovative way of selling wine in a large bottle and you're charged by them measuring the amount remaining in the bottle. The music was too loud with conversation taking place with uncomfortable shouting across the tableBut the food, the food, I hear you cry. Well, I did like the toppings with the butternut, bacon, stichelton and smoked onion being my favourite combo. However, the base didn't impress me - it was soft, making it hard to cut with the blunt pizza cutter. The middle of the pizza was too floppy, making eating the pizza very messy as fillings kept falling off. The edge was too doughy and most of our group left our crusts. I like my pizza bases more crispySorry, Homeslice but I can't really add my glowing love for you"

Add to that that they serve basically the best pizza I've ever eaten and they've avoided my ire entirely.With an ever-changing menu a return trip can be a little heart-wrenching (oh, Lincolnshire poacher how could you desert me?) but their menu options are always amazing and original (mint pesto? sure, why not?). The 20inch half and half is definitely the way to go and I've, so far, never been disappointed.I'm also overly fond of the giant wine bottles that they then measure to work out your bill; but that's primarily because that, paired with a giant pizza, means I can pretend to be a borrower. Always a good time.I've been here a few times now and will no doubt be back again.

Well worth giving it a try if you're in the area."

I must admit, upon entering the restaurant, I was a little skeptical (as I glimpsed paper plates being used). Definitely worth saying here - don't judge a book by its cover! The pizza was incredible! We ordered a 20\" half and half (one half:chorizo, coriander and corn, second half: ricotta, mushroom and chilli) and I couldn't help but gasp in awe when it hovered above our heads and served to our table. The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion). They also provided us with a pizza cutter (which always a plus in my books), which provided me with great entertainment as I watched my friends attempting to equally divide this gigantic creation!!"

I don't know if its the best pizza I have ever had, its good and the novelty 20\" size (two toping choice possible) is a great idea but to be honest it was a little bit floppy when cut. - a few people complain the cutters are blunt, and yeah they are but they get the job done!We turned up on a friday evening and had to put our name down for a table of 6. We were told it would be 30 minutes and turned up a little late, this was lucky as the table wasnt yet ready. When it was ready turned out they thought we said 3 people, to there credit they quickly sourced another table for three but in a different paet of the restaurant...... after a little chat with some other patrons we managed to get a table altogether. They have a good selection of beers and we had a cracking meal. The waitress was helpful with suggestions and also joined in on the lad banter that was going on. My one concern with this place is its very small and if you turn up at the wrong time you may just have to go hungry. :-("

We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever. Still, I don't feel we missed out on my first visit here.It can be busy at lunch time, but the wait was only 20 min.

The rest need to be bought as a £20 pizza - its recommended you share these and the restaurant will happily make them half one topping and half another.Positives:+ Pizzas (I tried 2) were really tasty, we finished all of our pizza easily.+ There are also some imaginative options (e.g. the cauliflower cheese pizza)+ Service was quick+ Decent value for moneyOn the other hand:- Limited tables for groups of 6+- Most choices require you to buy the 20\" pizza for £20 so not great unless you're at least 2 people, really hungry (I reckon I could eat a whole one myself if necessary, they're quite thin) or happy to take leftovers home- Our crusts were very salty, I liked the taste but that much salt must be v bad...Overall: We've become very picky about our Friday lunches as spoilt for choice around Covent Garden but we agreed unanimously that we'll come back here. Well worth giving it a try if you're in the area."

The not being able to reserve a table although annoying is made up for by the fact you can put your mobile number down and go for a drink, as they call you. Generally speaking the time estimate they give you is normally accurate, my most recent visit we did end up waiting a little longer, the bonus of this though was finding a little restaurant Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Neal's Yard that let us just order wine so will definitely head there in future. I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great.

The 1st time I stopped here on a Sunday evening around 3 pm and the line was out of the door with crowds milling about. I ran away.Went back at what I thought was an odd time (Monday afternoon 2 pm) and it was still packed but I managed to get a small spot to sit in after a 10 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

The not being able to reserve a table although annoying is made up for by the fact you can put your mobile number down and go for a drink, as they call you. Generally speaking the time estimate they give you is normally accurate, my most recent visit we did end up waiting a little longer, the bonus of this though was finding a little restaurant Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Neal's Yard that let us just order wine so will definitely head there in future. I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

But trust me, nowhere in London will you find pizza this incredible. Everything is tasty. My personal favourite is their chorizo, corn and coriander pizza (trust me, it just works). They also often have a lovely courgette pizza with a white base. Everything is delicious and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend."

The 1st time I stopped here on a Sunday evening around 3 pm and the line was out of the door with crowds milling about. I ran away.Went back at what I thought was an odd time (Monday afternoon 2 pm) and it was still packed but I managed to get a small spot to sit in after a 10 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

After another mystery, namely the core exam of my degree, we had to celebrate our survival with three pizzas and when my siblings visited me in lovely London I knew where to go as well. Homeslice has never disappointed me. I particularly like the goat's shoulder and savoy cabbage pizza, but would recommend any really. I like the cosy setup of the restaurant. Simple wooden tables and a good view on the burning wood oven. This is a true gem in the middle of the crowded West End."

Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4£ per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!"

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride."

The not being able to reserve a table although annoying is made up for by the fact you can put your mobile number down and go for a drink, as they call you. Generally speaking the time estimate they give you is normally accurate, my most recent visit we did end up waiting a little longer, the bonus of this though was finding a little restaurant Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Neal's Yard that let us just order wine so will definitely head there in future. I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

The 1st time I stopped here on a Sunday evening around 3 pm and the line was out of the door with crowds milling about. I ran away.Went back at what I thought was an odd time (Monday afternoon 2 pm) and it was still packed but I managed to get a small spot to sit in after a 10 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride."

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great.

I love the simplistic pricing and all the choices and combinations you can have for pizza.Me and my boyfriend were very hungry and decided to demolish one pizza between the two of us (which I personally think is impressive!) the 20\" pizza could probably feed 3 moderately hungry guests, especially if you wanted drinks etc.We ordered our pizza with half goat shoulder and kale and half classic margarita. It is a struggle for me to decide which one is better! The goat shoulder was very tender and flavourful. It tasted well balanced with kale leaves on the pizza. The tomato sauce on the margarita half tasted very fresh and slightly sweet. I do wish we had more basil on the margarita end though. Perhaps that is something we could request next time...The location is really cute, right inside neal's yard. Warning that this place can get very full quickly! And they don't take bookings. I suggest trying to get here either earlier or later than peak dining hours or trying a Sunday evening!"

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride."

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

It is a struggle for me to decide which one is better! The goat shoulder was very tender and flavourful. It tasted well balanced with kale leaves on the pizza.

This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great.

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

It is a colorful and enchanting little court yard just up the road from Covent Garden filled with a few other restaurants and little shops. When I came here, there was a two hour wait time for a table. This place gets filled up quick so if you're planning on going with a group, make sure you have a reservation or go super early. Thankfully, for those eager to try it out they do offer take away by the slice. Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4£ per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!"

After a somewhat boring hour of listening to a not so interesting professor she asked me whether I like pizza. Duh. Who does not like a good pizza? \"We ought to go to Neal's Yard\" she said. \"You will love it.\" So we walked.This was my first of frequent visits. My first ever slice was as she predicted loved and I took my self appointed task of introducing the place to numerous friends very seriously. After a geocache adventure we ended up in Homeslice and I converted two friends. After another mystery, namely the core exam of my degree, we had to celebrate our survival with three pizzas and when my siblings visited me in lovely London I knew where to go as well. Homeslice has never disappointed me. I particularly like the goat's shoulder and savoy cabbage pizza, but would recommend any really. I like the cosy setup of the restaurant. Simple wooden tables and a good view on the burning wood oven. This is a true gem in the middle of the crowded West End."

I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

It is a colorful and enchanting little court yard just up the road from Covent Garden filled with a few other restaurants and little shops. When I came here, there was a two hour wait time for a table. This place gets filled up quick so if you're planning on going with a group, make sure you have a reservation or go super early. Thankfully, for those eager to try it out they do offer take away by the slice. Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4£ per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!"

After a somewhat boring hour of listening to a not so interesting professor she asked me whether I like pizza. Duh. Who does not like a good pizza? \"We ought to go to Neal's Yard\" she said. \"You will love it.\" So we walked.This was my first of frequent visits. My first ever slice was as she predicted loved and I took my self appointed task of introducing the place to numerous friends very seriously. After a geocache adventure we ended up in Homeslice and I converted two friends. After another mystery, namely the core exam of my degree, we had to celebrate our survival with three pizzas and when my siblings visited me in lovely London I knew where to go as well. Homeslice has never disappointed me. I particularly like the goat's shoulder and savoy cabbage pizza, but would recommend any really. I like the cosy setup of the restaurant. Simple wooden tables and a good view on the burning wood oven. This is a true gem in the middle of the crowded West End."

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride."

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

I love the simplistic pricing and all the choices and combinations you can have for pizza.Me and my boyfriend were very hungry and decided to demolish one pizza between the two of us (which I personally think is impressive!) the 20\" pizza could probably feed 3 moderately hungry guests, especially if you wanted drinks etc.We ordered our pizza with half goat shoulder and kale and half classic margarita. It is a struggle for me to decide which one is better! The goat shoulder was very tender and flavourful. It tasted well balanced with kale leaves on the pizza. The tomato sauce on the margarita half tasted very fresh and slightly sweet. I do wish we had more basil on the margarita end though. Perhaps that is something we could request next time...The location is really cute, right inside neal's yard. Warning that this place can get very full quickly! And they don't take bookings. I suggest trying to get here either earlier or later than peak dining hours or trying a Sunday evening!"

You can leave your phone number with them and they'll call you when a table is ready (no phoned in reservations though).The dough was perfection. There's no leaving the crust on these pizzas! I got the chorizo, corn, and scallions pizza (YES best combination of all my favorite things on one pizza). The large is....large. Very worth it. Come hungry!"

We bought a large pizza half veggie and half carne for the meat eaters. My veggie half had zucchini and artichokes and was super yummy. I did try a piece of the salami and rocket, after pulling off the salami and it was super delish. The 3 of us were very full at the end of £20 (not including drinks). Very affordable and good value for London! I recommend this place!"

Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution.

The pizza was a little oily but still fine.  The size is great for sharing between 2 or 3.The wine model is great - they basically just leave a massive bottle on the table and you help yourself. When you come to leave, they measure the wine drunk with a ruler and charge you accordingly.It's a little hidden away, but it's worth the search to find it - highly recommended."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

I'm from New York and I've had some good pizza, but this was by far one of the best pies I've ever had. My friend and I ordered the 20 inch pie with half salami/rocket, half cauliflower cheese/auberjine/spinach. Both were amazing!Definitely my goto spot for when I'm craving wonderfully made thin crust pizza"

The pizza was a little oily but still fine.  The size is great for sharing between 2 or 3.The wine model is great - they basically just leave a massive bottle on the table and you help yourself. When you come to leave, they measure the wine drunk with a ruler and charge you accordingly.It's a little hidden away, but it's worth the search to find it - highly recommended."

And of course local draught  beer is extra bonus. Friendly staff is more than happy to recommend you their favourite pizza.  And let me tell you I have few favourites there! I guess you know where I am going with this : yes the pizza is really good. Usually you cannot measure quality by quantity, not in here though. Just wait till you see the size of it.

That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish.

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens?

No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face.

You can get half and half on a whole pizza which is 20 pounds or by the slice is 4. The wine we got was just a house red. Tasty for being a house wine. They give you 1.5 liters of wine and charge you for every glass you drink. There are 11 glasses in each bottle and we finished the bottle. The glasses are four pounds each so we spent 44 on wine. 64 total for 4 people in Covent garden area is not bad at all. I would recommend putting your name in and going to a nearby pub though because the wait is typically pretty long. Fabulous pizza and the weight staff was pretty friendly! I'll be going back next time I'm in London."

I prefer more of a NY style pizza - and found the crust to be not so yummy and the bottom too soft and also burnt in some spaces. The sauce, though was quite yummy.If you're in the neighborhood, shopping or roaming around central - stop by for a relaxed slice or two but don't expect to have your socks totally blown off."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution.

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

You can get half and half on a whole pizza which is 20 pounds or by the slice is 4. The wine we got was just a house red. Tasty for being a house wine. They give you 1.5 liters of wine and charge you for every glass you drink. There are 11 glasses in each bottle and we finished the bottle. The glasses are four pounds each so we spent 44 on wine. 64 total for 4 people in Covent garden area is not bad at all. I would recommend putting your name in and going to a nearby pub though because the wait is typically pretty long. Fabulous pizza and the weight staff was pretty friendly! I'll be going back next time I'm in London."

There were four of us, so no reservations, but they kindly took my phone number to call us when our table was ready.The only downside is the place is small. The tables are small. There were people spilling over into our area when we first sat down, but once they left we had quite a bit more room.They keep is super simple. £20 a pie which you can order half-and-half if you like. They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's £44. (And for a magnum! That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied.

Let's start with the pizza. Huge pies, thin slices, served on paper plates with no utensils. I think this might freak Londoners out, not being able to cut your pizza with a fork and knife. However, as an American who loves finger food, I'm all for it. I'm a big fan of a pie that has salami and rocket but you can do half and half, which is useful for parties with different tastes. The wine is house BUT it is perfect for those who want more than one glass but don't want to commit to a full bottle. I've only had the red-- it wasn't the best wine I've ever had, but I like that i only pay for what I drink. All in all, I would definitely recommend!"

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

You can get half and half on a whole pizza which is 20 pounds or by the slice is 4. The wine we got was just a house red. Tasty for being a house wine. They give you 1.5 liters of wine and charge you for every glass you drink. There are 11 glasses in each bottle and we finished the bottle. The glasses are four pounds each so we spent 44 on wine. 64 total for 4 people in Covent garden area is not bad at all. I would recommend putting your name in and going to a nearby pub though because the wait is typically pretty long. Fabulous pizza and the weight staff was pretty friendly! I'll be going back next time I'm in London."

Let's start with the pizza. Huge pies, thin slices, served on paper plates with no utensils. I think this might freak Londoners out, not being able to cut your pizza with a fork and knife. However, as an American who loves finger food, I'm all for it. I'm a big fan of a pie that has salami and rocket but you can do half and half, which is useful for parties with different tastes. The wine is house BUT it is perfect for those who want more than one glass but don't want to commit to a full bottle. I've only had the red-- it wasn't the best wine I've ever had, but I like that i only pay for what I drink. All in all, I would definitely recommend!"

Courgette and artichoke is surprisingly good."

The last-minute actuality: Nava, Adam and I went for cocktails nearby until the other half was free and the four of us went to get some pizza. There were four of us, so no reservations, but they kindly took my phone number to call us when our table was ready.The only downside is the place is small. The tables are small. There were people spilling over into our area when we first sat down, but once they left we had quite a bit more room.They keep is super simple. £20 a pie which you can order half-and-half if you like. They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's £44. (And for a magnum! That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied. And I know I'll be back when I'm craving one of the best pizzas in London."

The pizza came.  It was big.  It was beautiful.  It was 'just ok.\" Skip the wine in the jug. It comes from a box, and tears the tummy to bits in seconds. Stick with the cold yummy beer. Servers were fun and efficient. This  place is full of energy and happening.  I'd go back to drink and meet new people, but not for dinner."

I went here with some colleagues from work during a lunch break - what a nice spot.  Nestled into Neal's Yard inside Covent Garden, this is a great space to bring a small group.There are a bunch of pizzas to choose from (the classics all the way from black pudding or oxtaill to mushroom and ricotta).  The 20 quid whole pizza is more than enough for two people (or you can bring home!) or you can opt for couple slices at 4 quid each.  Though I ordered the  half Caprese pizza and half corn and chrizo, I was actually happier with my colleague's choice of plain ole marinara and salami at half and half.Service: Friendly and quick - they came over a few times to check on us & collect napkins - nice vibe!Food: Pizza in London is getting better and better. 3 years ago I would have been  blown away and so excited to finally have some sort of decent pizza but now with the likes of Pizza East and Rays cropping up - I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. I prefer more of a NY style pizza - and found the crust to be not so yummy and the bottom too soft and also burnt in some spaces. The sauce, though was quite yummy.If you're in the neighborhood, shopping or roaming around central - stop by for a relaxed slice or two but don't expect to have your socks totally blown off."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

When you come to leave, they measure the wine drunk with a ruler and charge you accordingly.It's a little hidden away, but it's worth the search to find it - highly recommended."

One was more than enough for two very hungry men.This all came for under £15 a head in Convent Garden. Home Slice feels like a friend who desperately wants you to like it and boy, it's easy to like."

Very satisfactory foodie experience. Their other pizzas are quite tasty and original, too. Everything washed down with a decent lager. Plus, very professional and warm service. I'll stop more often every time I'm in Seven Dials!"

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

Imagine the best pizza you've had - this is better. I'm a particular fan, somewhat bizarrely, of the crust - it's jam-packed full of flavour.My one gripe with HomeSlice is that it's ever-so-slightly inconsistent. Pizzas can come slightly under- or over-cooked, and with quite significant variations in the amount of toppings - like a distinct dearth of mozzarella on my last visit.Everything I've just said negatively about HomeSlice, however, is entitled and should be ignored. That I'm able to be so bloody picky about pizza in London is quite frankly incredible. But when you've tasted pizza perfection at HomeSlice, continued pursuit of that perfection becomes addictive."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

Straight out of the pizza oven come almost impossibly thin and crispy pizzas with few ingredients. The margherita is a standout as a direct result of this - the ingredients do the talking. Imagine the best pizza you've had - this is better. I'm a particular fan, somewhat bizarrely, of the crust - it's jam-packed full of flavour.My one gripe with HomeSlice is that it's ever-so-slightly inconsistent. Pizzas can come slightly under- or over-cooked, and with quite significant variations in the amount of toppings - like a distinct dearth of mozzarella on my last visit.Everything I've just said negatively about HomeSlice, however, is entitled and should be ignored. That I'm able to be so bloody picky about pizza in London is quite frankly incredible. But when you've tasted pizza perfection at HomeSlice, continued pursuit of that perfection becomes addictive."

Okay, so four slices for £20 kind of sucks compared to a whole pizza for £20, but when you can only finish two (mind you, they are huge), it's £8 really well spent. Plus, I don't know any other pizza joint in London that does slices (if you do, hit me up!)I feel like you either love it or hate it here. The first time I was like, why is the base so chewy?? I don't understandd.. This is not pizza?!?! And by the fifth slice I think my jaw was a little tired.. How I even ate that much I do not know. But I now know this to be 'real' new york pizza and hey, I like it. So it's sometimes too charred at the bottom and its floppyness gets annoying at times but they really do the best flavours!They used to have this amazing mushroom one with maybe feta and pumpkin seeds with the best balsamic glaze drizzled over. I can't explain it but there's something about the ambitious complexity of flavours that you don't ever expect on pizza. It's so unassuming! I really like mushrooms and have had them foamed, freeze dried and turned into sand at fancy fine dining places but this is my favourite mushroom 'dish' OF ALL TIME. Well, was :( :( :( :( :( (I REALLY AM VERY SAD ABOUT THIS PLEASE BRING IT BACK!)I'd go into more detail about the other varieties but this rambling review is long enough so in short, yes it's crowded and busy and there's a line at any sensible hour but noooooo, just get take away, take the slice out of its little baggie, fold the plate in half and sort of slide the pizza into your mouth as you walk around seven dials. Simple. LIFE SORTED."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

No pasta, no sides, just pizza. £4/slice or £20 for a 20 inch pizza that's begging to be shared by at least two.Pizza. So what? Why not go to Domino's?Because this is the best pizza in London. Straight out of the pizza oven come almost impossibly thin and crispy pizzas with few ingredients. The margherita is a standout as a direct result of this - the ingredients do the talking. Imagine the best pizza you've had - this is better. I'm a particular fan, somewhat bizarrely, of the crust - it's jam-packed full of flavour.My one gripe with HomeSlice is that it's ever-so-slightly inconsistent. Pizzas can come slightly under- or over-cooked, and with quite significant variations in the amount of toppings - like a distinct dearth of mozzarella on my last visit.Everything I've just said negatively about HomeSlice, however, is entitled and should be ignored. That I'm able to be so bloody picky about pizza in London is quite frankly incredible. But when you've tasted pizza perfection at HomeSlice, continued pursuit of that perfection becomes addictive."

Okay, so four slices for £20 kind of sucks compared to a whole pizza for £20, but when you can only finish two (mind you, they are huge), it's £8 really well spent. Plus, I don't know any other pizza joint in London that does slices (if you do, hit me up!)I feel like you either love it or hate it here. The first time I was like, why is the base so chewy?? I don't understandd.. This is not pizza?!?! And by the fifth slice I think my jaw was a little tired.. How I even ate that much I do not know. But I now know this to be 'real' new york pizza and hey, I like it. So it's sometimes too charred at the bottom and its floppyness gets annoying at times but they really do the best flavours!They used to have this amazing mushroom one with maybe feta and pumpkin seeds with the best balsamic glaze drizzled over. I can't explain it but there's something about the ambitious complexity of flavours that you don't ever expect on pizza. It's so unassuming! I really like mushrooms and have had them foamed, freeze dried and turned into sand at fancy fine dining places but this is my favourite mushroom 'dish' OF ALL TIME. Well, was :( :( :( :( :( (I REALLY AM VERY SAD ABOUT THIS PLEASE BRING IT BACK!)I'd go into more detail about the other varieties but this rambling review is long enough so in short, yes it's crowded and busy and there's a line at any sensible hour but noooooo, just get take away, take the slice out of its little baggie, fold the plate in half and sort of slide the pizza into your mouth as you walk around seven dials.

It definitely was a bit tricky to eat this pizza with no utensils.We opted for a half half of oxtail and salami which set us back 20GBP for a giant 20in pizza. They also offer some pizzas by the slice. The pizza crust was thin and crispy which was great for the first couple of slices but as the minutes ticked by it inevitably got softer and harder to eat. This is where the fork would have come in handy! The oxtail was good but a bit heavy on the horseradish. The salami was yum. Lots of crispy salami pieces topped with rocket!Seating can be a cramped here and it was hard to get in and out as the seats are pretty close together."

You can split the toppings if you want, which allows for trying out different toppings at once. Also should you want just a slice you can from their regular pizzas. However at £4 a slice the value isnt great. The pizzas are £20 each, which between 3/4 is totally excellent value, because:THE PIZZAS ARE BLOODY AMAZING!!!!!!Oh my word, garlicy, cripsy and soft, with generous toppings, exotic but balanced. I'm salivating just thinking about this place.Every time i've been its been rammed, regardless of which day of the night it is, so book ahead.

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

Seriously though, the size of the tables is my one gripe about this place.  You have a booth for people to sit in, but the table is maybe only 2/3 the length of the booth.  Weird.But the pizza!  Oh, the pizza!  It's thin crust, which I find to be a necessity.  The pizza is a bit floppy and does require folding for munching, but it takes you back to an American sloppiness without the British politeness of eating pizza with utensils that I love.  We tried four types that evening, but the standout for me was the bone marrow pizza.  The oxtail and horseradish is a great flavor combo, but when I grabbed my slice, all the sauce came careening off, so that was a bit of a bummer.  The menu is super simple, and if you missed it on the board when you walked in, the waitstaff has pictures of it on ipads for you to take a gander.The waitstaff is hipster quirky for sure, but also super friendly and didn't even give us the stinkeye once, despite our closing the place down for the evening.I've already sung the praises of Homeslice to others, so I will hopefully be back soon!"

It definitely was a bit tricky to eat this pizza with no utensils.We opted for a half half of oxtail and salami which set us back 20GBP for a giant 20in pizza. They also offer some pizzas by the slice. The pizza crust was thin and crispy which was great for the first couple of slices but as the minutes ticked by it inevitably got softer and harder to eat. This is where the fork would have come in handy! The oxtail was good but a bit heavy on the horseradish. The salami was yum. Lots of crispy salami pieces topped with rocket!Seating can be a cramped here and it was hard to get in and out as the seats are pretty close together."

Seriously though, the size of the tables is my one gripe about this place.  You have a booth for people to sit in, but the table is maybe only 2/3 the length of the booth.  Weird.But the pizza!  Oh, the pizza!  It's thin crust, which I find to be a necessity.  The pizza is a bit floppy and does require folding for munching, but it takes you back to an American sloppiness without the British politeness of eating pizza with utensils that I love.  We tried four types that evening, but the standout for me was the bone marrow pizza.  The oxtail and horseradish is a great flavor combo, but when I grabbed my slice, all the sauce came careening off, so that was a bit of a bummer.  The menu is super simple, and if you missed it on the board when you walked in, the waitstaff has pictures of it on ipads for you to take a gander.The waitstaff is hipster quirky for sure, but also super friendly and didn't even give us the stinkeye once, despite our closing the place down for the evening.I've already sung the praises of Homeslice to others, so I will hopefully be back soon!"

Mouth full.Tucked in the somewhat hard to find Neal's Yard, I was so excited to see my favourite pizza food stall go brick and mortar. This is arguably my favourite pizza in London. Now, I know this is a controversial topic, so please don't jump all over me with how much you were disappointed once you tried it based on this review. If you like SUPER crispy pizza, this won't be for you. If you like super 'authentic' (whatever that means), this won't be for you.If you like interesting, if not experimental, toppings, intense and well thought out flavour, doughy, well-salted crust that is crisp on the outside, but delightfully chewy in the centre, this may be for you. You sort of have to fold it in half to eat it. Yes, eat it with your hands.£20 will buy you a massive, 20inch pizza. You can choose two different pizzas and go half and half on the same 'pie' (as they say in America). They also have beer (just one kind?), and wine that they let you pour yourself. They come around with a ruler afterwards to see how much has been drunk and charge you based on that. Their tomato sauce is really nice-- super tangy. Andrew M. and I tried a half artichoke/courgette, half pork belly pizza. I preferred the lemony artichoke and courgette (with a garlic non-tomato base), but both were tasty. Next time, I want to try the basic fresh mozzarella/tomato/basil 'caprese' pizza. a good standard by which to judge pizza ingredients.**UPDATE: The Caprese is delicious too!!!! Possibly my favourite. Straight foward, tangy, and SO fresh tasting."

You can split the toppings if you want, which allows for trying out different toppings at once. Also should you want just a slice you can from their regular pizzas. However at £4 a slice the value isnt great.

At one point we just looked at each other and said \"it's the olive oil that makes the difference - you can taste it so clearly!\" (referring to both the olive oil in the tomato sauce and the one on the dough). Very satisfactory foodie experience. Their other pizzas are quite tasty and original, too. Everything washed down with a decent lager. Plus, very professional and warm service.

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

No pasta, no sides, just pizza. £4/slice or £20 for a 20 inch pizza that's begging to be shared by at least two.Pizza. So what? Why not go to Domino's?Because this is the best pizza in London. Straight out of the pizza oven come almost impossibly thin and crispy pizzas with few ingredients. The margherita is a standout as a direct result of this - the ingredients do the talking. Imagine the best pizza you've had - this is better. I'm a particular fan, somewhat bizarrely, of the crust - it's jam-packed full of flavour.My one gripe with HomeSlice is that it's ever-so-slightly inconsistent. Pizzas can come slightly under- or over-cooked, and with quite significant variations in the amount of toppings - like a distinct dearth of mozzarella on my last visit.Everything I've just said negatively about HomeSlice, however, is entitled and should be ignored. That I'm able to be so bloody picky about pizza in London is quite frankly incredible. But when you've tasted pizza perfection at HomeSlice, continued pursuit of that perfection becomes addictive."

Very satisfactory foodie experience. Their other pizzas are quite tasty and original, too. Everything washed down with a decent lager. Plus, very professional and warm service.

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

Imagine the best pizza you've had - this is better. I'm a particular fan, somewhat bizarrely, of the crust - it's jam-packed full of flavour.My one gripe with HomeSlice is that it's ever-so-slightly inconsistent. Pizzas can come slightly under- or over-cooked, and with quite significant variations in the amount of toppings - like a distinct dearth of mozzarella on my last visit.Everything I've just said negatively about HomeSlice, however, is entitled and should be ignored. That I'm able to be so bloody picky about pizza in London is quite frankly incredible. But when you've tasted pizza perfection at HomeSlice, continued pursuit of that perfection becomes addictive."

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

Straight out of the pizza oven come almost impossibly thin and crispy pizzas with few ingredients. The margherita is a standout as a direct result of this - the ingredients do the talking. Imagine the best pizza you've had - this is better. I'm a particular fan, somewhat bizarrely, of the crust - it's jam-packed full of flavour.My one gripe with HomeSlice is that it's ever-so-slightly inconsistent. Pizzas can come slightly under- or over-cooked, and with quite significant variations in the amount of toppings - like a distinct dearth of mozzarella on my last visit.Everything I've just said negatively about HomeSlice, however, is entitled and should be ignored. That I'm able to be so bloody picky about pizza in London is quite frankly incredible. But when you've tasted pizza perfection at HomeSlice, continued pursuit of that perfection becomes addictive."

Okay, so four slices for £20 kind of sucks compared to a whole pizza for £20, but when you can only finish two (mind you, they are huge), it's £8 really well spent. Plus, I don't know any other pizza joint in London that does slices (if you do, hit me up!)I feel like you either love it or hate it here. The first time I was like, why is the base so chewy?? I don't understandd.. This is not pizza?!?! And by the fifth slice I think my jaw was a little tired.. How I even ate that much I do not know. But I now know this to be 'real' new york pizza and hey, I like it. So it's sometimes too charred at the bottom and its floppyness gets annoying at times but they really do the best flavours!They used to have this amazing mushroom one with maybe feta and pumpkin seeds with the best balsamic glaze drizzled over. I can't explain it but there's something about the ambitious complexity of flavours that you don't ever expect on pizza. It's so unassuming! I really like mushrooms and have had them foamed, freeze dried and turned into sand at fancy fine dining places but this is my favourite mushroom 'dish' OF ALL TIME. Well, was :( :( :( :( :( (I REALLY AM VERY SAD ABOUT THIS PLEASE BRING IT BACK!)I'd go into more detail about the other varieties but this rambling review is long enough so in short, yes it's crowded and busy and there's a line at any sensible hour but noooooo, just get take away, take the slice out of its little baggie, fold the plate in half and sort of slide the pizza into your mouth as you walk around seven dials. Simple. LIFE SORTED."

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

No pasta, no sides, just pizza. £4/slice or £20 for a 20 inch pizza that's begging to be shared by at least two.Pizza. So what? Why not go to Domino's?Because this is the best pizza in London. Straight out of the pizza oven come almost impossibly thin and crispy pizzas with few ingredients. The margherita is a standout as a direct result of this - the ingredients do the talking. Imagine the best pizza you've had - this is better. I'm a particular fan, somewhat bizarrely, of the crust - it's jam-packed full of flavour.My one gripe with HomeSlice is that it's ever-so-slightly inconsistent. Pizzas can come slightly under- or over-cooked, and with quite significant variations in the amount of toppings - like a distinct dearth of mozzarella on my last visit.Everything I've just said negatively about HomeSlice, however, is entitled and should be ignored. That I'm able to be so bloody picky about pizza in London is quite frankly incredible. But when you've tasted pizza perfection at HomeSlice, continued pursuit of that perfection becomes addictive."

Okay, so four slices for £20 kind of sucks compared to a whole pizza for £20, but when you can only finish two (mind you, they are huge), it's £8 really well spent. Plus, I don't know any other pizza joint in London that does slices (if you do, hit me up!)I feel like you either love it or hate it here. The first time I was like, why is the base so chewy?? I don't understandd.. This is not pizza?!?! And by the fifth slice I think my jaw was a little tired.. How I even ate that much I do not know. But I now know this to be 'real' new york pizza and hey, I like it. So it's sometimes too charred at the bottom and its floppyness gets annoying at times but they really do the best flavours!They used to have this amazing mushroom one with maybe feta and pumpkin seeds with the best balsamic glaze drizzled over. I can't explain it but there's something about the ambitious complexity of flavours that you don't ever expect on pizza. It's so unassuming! I really like mushrooms and have had them foamed, freeze dried and turned into sand at fancy fine dining places but this is my favourite mushroom 'dish' OF ALL TIME. Well, was :( :( :( :( :( (I REALLY AM VERY SAD ABOUT THIS PLEASE BRING IT BACK!)I'd go into more detail about the other varieties but this rambling review is long enough so in short, yes it's crowded and busy and there's a line at any sensible hour but noooooo, just get take away, take the slice out of its little baggie, fold the plate in half and sort of slide the pizza into your mouth as you walk around seven dials.

It definitely was a bit tricky to eat this pizza with no utensils.We opted for a half half of oxtail and salami which set us back 20GBP for a giant 20in pizza. They also offer some pizzas by the slice. The pizza crust was thin and crispy which was great for the first couple of slices but as the minutes ticked by it inevitably got softer and harder to eat. This is where the fork would have come in handy! The oxtail was good but a bit heavy on the horseradish. The salami was yum. Lots of crispy salami pieces topped with rocket!Seating can be a cramped here and it was hard to get in and out as the seats are pretty close together."

You can split the toppings if you want, which allows for trying out different toppings at once. Also should you want just a slice you can from their regular pizzas. However at £4 a slice the value isnt great. The pizzas are £20 each, which between 3/4 is totally excellent value, because:THE PIZZAS ARE BLOODY AMAZING!!!!!!Oh my word, garlicy, cripsy and soft, with generous toppings, exotic but balanced.

Seriously though, the size of the tables is my one gripe about this place.  You have a booth for people to sit in, but the table is maybe only 2/3 the length of the booth.  Weird.But the pizza!  Oh, the pizza!  It's thin crust, which I find to be a necessity.  The pizza is a bit floppy and does require folding for munching, but it takes you back to an American sloppiness without the British politeness of eating pizza with utensils that I love.  We tried four types that evening, but the standout for me was the bone marrow pizza.  The oxtail and horseradish is a great flavor combo, but when I grabbed my slice, all the sauce came careening off, so that was a bit of a bummer.  The menu is super simple, and if you missed it on the board when you walked in, the waitstaff has pictures of it on ipads for you to take a gander.The waitstaff is hipster quirky for sure, but also super friendly and didn't even give us the stinkeye once, despite our closing the place down for the evening.I've already sung the praises of Homeslice to others, so I will hopefully be back soon!"

Pizzas can come slightly under- or over-cooked, and with quite significant variations in the amount of toppings - like a distinct dearth of mozzarella on my last visit.Everything I've just said negatively about HomeSlice, however, is entitled and should be ignored. That I'm able to be so bloody picky about pizza in London is quite frankly incredible. But when you've tasted pizza perfection at HomeSlice, continued pursuit of that perfection becomes addictive."

Okay, so four slices for £20 kind of sucks compared to a whole pizza for £20, but when you can only finish two (mind you, they are huge), it's £8 really well spent.

I don't understandd.. This is not pizza?!?! And by the fifth slice I think my jaw was a little tired.. How I even ate that much I do not know. But I now know this to be 'real' new york pizza and hey, I like it. So it's sometimes too charred at the bottom and its floppyness gets annoying at times but they really do the best flavours!They used to have this amazing mushroom one with maybe feta and pumpkin seeds with the best balsamic glaze drizzled over. I can't explain it but there's something about the ambitious complexity of flavours that you don't ever expect on pizza. It's so unassuming!

It definitely was a bit tricky to eat this pizza with no utensils.We opted for a half half of oxtail and salami which set us back 20GBP for a giant 20in pizza. They also offer some pizzas by the slice. The pizza crust was thin and crispy which was great for the first couple of slices but as the minutes ticked by it inevitably got softer and harder to eat. This is where the fork would have come in handy! The oxtail was good but a bit heavy on the horseradish. The salami was yum. Lots of crispy salami pieces topped with rocket!Seating can be a cramped here and it was hard to get in and out as the seats are pretty close together."

Now, I know this is a controversial topic, so please don't jump all over me with how much you were disappointed once you tried it based on this review. If you like SUPER crispy pizza, this won't be for you. If you like super 'authentic' (whatever that means), this won't be for you.If you like interesting, if not experimental, toppings, intense and well thought out flavour, doughy, well-salted crust that is crisp on the outside, but delightfully chewy in the centre, this may be for you. You sort of have to fold it in half to eat it. Yes, eat it with your hands.£20 will buy you a massive, 20inch pizza. You can choose two different pizzas and go half and half on the same 'pie' (as they say in America). They also have beer (just one kind?), and wine that they let you pour yourself. They come around with a ruler afterwards to see how much has been drunk and charge you based on that. Their tomato sauce is really nice-- super tangy. Andrew M. and I tried a half artichoke/courgette, half pork belly pizza. I preferred the lemony artichoke and courgette (with a garlic non-tomato base), but both were tasty. Next time, I want to try the basic fresh mozzarella/tomato/basil 'caprese' pizza. a good standard by which to judge pizza ingredients.**UPDATE: The Caprese is delicious too!!!! Possibly my favourite. Straight foward, tangy, and SO fresh tasting."

You can split the toppings if you want, which allows for trying out different toppings at once. Also should you want just a slice you can from their regular pizzas. However at £4 a slice the value isnt great. The pizzas are £20 each, which between 3/4 is totally excellent value, because:THE PIZZAS ARE BLOODY AMAZING!!!!!!Oh my word, garlicy, cripsy and soft, with generous toppings, exotic but balanced. I'm salivating just thinking about this place.Every time i've been its been rammed, regardless of which day of the night it is, so book ahead. Failing that we never had to wait too long for one, and just ate it in Neal's yard. Oh homeslice, be in edinburgh please?!"

I will definitely try this on my next pizza I make."

I went twice so far. Last night I ordered a Margherita and I devoured it with my friend. At one point we just looked at each other and said \"it's the olive oil that makes the difference - you can taste it so clearly!\" (referring to both the olive oil in the tomato sauce and the one on the dough). Very satisfactory foodie experience. Their other pizzas are quite tasty and original, too. Everything washed down with a decent lager. Plus, very professional and warm service. I'll stop more often every time I'm in Seven Dials!"

The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile."

And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at £4 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's £44! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed."

Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it.

Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless.

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great. Ours were the Rocket and Italian Salami ( forgot the correct name) and the Margherita.  FANTASTIC!!!!"

The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times!

The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!"

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed.

The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

The first time we had a half oxtail half margherita pizza and it was amazing, but bewarned - it's a bit messy! Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!"

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night.  Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

I SAID...BRING ME THE HOMESLICE.  BRING IT NOW! NOW! NOW! ARRRRRRGGHHHH!"

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great.

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

After asking to be moved to the front I was looking forward to the sparkling stuff on tap only to be told they had run out.The menu is my type of menu only 8 items 4 of which you could have by the slice.We went for a half and half 20 inch Margarita and half bone marrow.The pizza come on a wooden board with slicer ready for you to divi up to your partyIt was truly amazing the bone marrow half was meaty and moorish and the margarita reminded me of a New York pizza Yummy!Seek out home slice you wont be disappointed!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses.

        "comments": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless.

I SAID...BRING ME THE HOMESLICE.  BRING IT NOW! NOW! NOW! ARRRRRRGGHHHH!"

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well.

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great.

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies.

We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

The slices (only 3 kinds are sold as slices) are so thin but full of flavor. I recommend the margherita slice/pie. It's a classic and they do it well. I sat outside which was so nice but they had a time limit so if you're with a group, don't sit outside. 55 minutes only"

Great unusual pies as well as the traditional fare. My ass is getting bigger just eating all the pies. You can eat in or take out. We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great.

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

        "comments": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it.

Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

What massive idiots.  Just round the corner is stunning wood fired pizza slices.  I only had margarita, it was full of flavour, with a charred base that tasted slightly sweet.  You eat this New York style, folded up on a paper plate.  The chilli oil in the skull is a not quite as scary as it looks, actually is tasty.  The beer is cold and goes perfectly. Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

I SAID...BRING ME THE HOMESLICE.  BRING IT NOW! NOW! NOW! ARRRRRRGGHHHH!"

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way."

We carried out and ate in the courtyard on a rare beatiful London night. We did not have but heard the ox tail and horseradish was great.

        "comments": "I usually feel a bit sad when one of my favourite traders gives up the street for more permanent digs but it's good to know Homeslice doesn't have any such problems. The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the  staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot."

The main draws - fresh local ingredients, tangy sauces, and a light flavourful base all baked to order in a wood fired oven - still remain.  It's pretty hard not to love it, and even more so when you realise you can have a meal without trading away your first born.Homeslice takes reservations for groups of 5-10 for the two sharing tables but all others are walk-in only. At 7pm on a sunny Wednesday evening, the place was busy but we managed to get  a spot for two with no problem at all.They have about 7-8 pizzas to choose from with two different bases. There is one menu outside and one just past the door - in proper rustic style they are handwritten on massive chalkboards. Most are made with a  tangy tomato based sauce (marked with a \"T\") but a couple have a white garlic-based sauce instead. Oh, and don't worry if you can't make up your mind as you can get the a half'n'half to combine your picks. This worked out perfectly for Katie B and I so we opted for the pork belly with chimichurri and smoked onions and the courgette & artichoke.The pizza arrived in almost no time (benefit of the ultra thin base) and it's a big and beautiful sight. Keep in mind this isn't your crispy Italian style base that is more cracker than bread - instead this felt a bit like a chapatti with a flexible and slightly chewy texture about it. This means a bit of NY style folding of each slice is necessary but there is nothing wrong with that. Taste wise, the pizza is excellent. The pork belly was tender from the earlier slow cooking but the quick cooking time in the oven meant it hadn't dried out. I think I prefer the tangy tomato base to the garlic-butterness of the courgette pizza, but both were delicious. The light dusting of salt helps bring out the sweetness in the base as well. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the courgette and artichoke pizza. Both veggies are thinly sliced into long pieces and retain a good amount of crunch without being too rigid. The garlic base is a perfect complement with a mild and delicate flavour complementing rather than over powering the flavours of the veggies. It almost felt like a healthy pizza if such thing exists!Staying with the simple menu theme, drinks are pretty basic. You can order beer, red or white wine, and I believe even a prosecco. No brands or names are in evidence with the beer being drawn from the tap in the wall straight to mug and wine arriving in clear bottles. In fact, they give you a full bottle of wine to start and at the end measure the liquid level to see how much you drank and charge your accordingly. From the gasps of astonishment of other diners, I'm guessing the value was a lot better than expected. The beer is a bit of a weak lager but went well with the pizza on such a warm day.£20 for a 20\" pizza is brilliant and a pint of beer or glass of wine is just £4. You can't beat those prices in the middle of Covent Garden and any pub would be hard pressed to match the price let alone the quality. I can't wait to go back to try the Caprese or the Bone Marrow and Watercress pizzas!"

After asking to be moved to the front I was looking forward to the sparkling stuff on tap only to be told they had run out.The menu is my type of menu only 8 items 4 of which you could have by the slice.We went for a half and half 20 inch Margarita and half bone marrow.The pizza come on a wooden board with slicer ready for you to divi up to your partyIt was truly amazing the bone marrow half was meaty and moorish and the margarita reminded me of a New York pizza Yummy!Seek out home slice you wont be disappointed!"

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

What massive idiots.  Just round the corner is stunning wood fired pizza slices.  I only had margarita, it was full of flavour, with a charred base that tasted slightly sweet.  You eat this New York style, folded up on a paper plate.  The chilli oil in the skull is a not quite as scary as it looks, actually is tasty.  The beer is cold and goes perfectly. Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

        "comments": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges £4 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice."

What massive idiots.  Just round the corner is stunning wood fired pizza slices.  I only had margarita, it was full of flavour, with a charred base that tasted slightly sweet.  You eat this New York style, folded up on a paper plate.  The chilli oil in the skull is a not quite as scary as it looks, actually is tasty.  The beer is cold and goes perfectly. Great service.  On a Saturday it was dead at 12.30, but suddenly packed at 1.  Would go back, many times :)"

        "comments": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (£20 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter.  My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork."

I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after  until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself."

It is a small place and gets busy because its delicious, so you might have to wait. They have slices to take away as well. We had the half salami/ rocket & half mushroom, ricotta & pumpkin seeds (SOOOO DELICIOUS!!), and half scallop, garlic and pancetta, half lamb shoulder and goats cheese (even better!!!) . I cannot recommend this place enough if you want a fun girls night out or a great date night."

Neil's Yard is so charming and the food, beer, and wine at Homeslice were a perfect addition to that charm. The pizzas \"look\" huge, but are very thinly made ~ so you eat more than you think (and still have some to take home). We had half caprese, half asparagus/ricotta/pepper. We loved it and highly recommend!!!"

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time.

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy.

Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious.

Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime. I'm very keen to go back and their interesting, exciting toppings certainly help them stand apart from the competition."

Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime. I'm very keen to go back and their interesting, exciting toppings certainly help them stand apart from the competition."

Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy. I appreciate that they offer the choice of flavours with tomato sauce and others with white sauce."

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime. I'm very keen to go back and their interesting, exciting toppings certainly help them stand apart from the competition."

The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours.

You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices.

I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

I usually don't like eating in public, especially when there is so many people looking at me. My room mates ordered for home the biggest pizza I have seen. Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza. The only waiting you have to do is while the pretty baked good comes to you, as often there is a crowd of hungry people who are also waiting."

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around £44 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends. Also note that this place is particularly busy so it does get really loud. This doesn't diminish the excellent service that we had. I would come back again!"

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu. The place does get pretty full, so try to come at a time you think it will be less crowded."

I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza. The only waiting you have to do is while the pretty baked good comes to you, as often there is a crowd of hungry people who are also waiting."

Very fresh tasting with bold exciting flavours.The sumac yoghurt was a tad too liberally applied so overpowered the rest of the toppings but nonetheless was truly great.The real showstopper was the BBQ brisket which was an inspired choice.These pizza's are huge so one can be comfortably shared by two people unless you feel brave and go for one each (I did and had LOTS of leftovers).Drink selection was limited but they offered me a Brixton beer which is now a new fave.Win win."

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around £44 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends. Also note that this place is particularly busy so it does get really loud. This doesn't diminish the excellent service that we had. I would come back again!"

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu. The place does get pretty full, so try to come at a time you think it will be less crowded."

Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime.

You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours.

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time.

The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit.

Very fresh tasting with bold exciting flavours.The sumac yoghurt was a tad too liberally applied so overpowered the rest of the toppings but nonetheless was truly great.The real showstopper was the BBQ brisket which was an inspired choice.These pizza's are huge so one can be comfortably shared by two people unless you feel brave and go for one each (I did and had LOTS of leftovers).Drink selection was limited but they offered me a Brixton beer which is now a new fave.Win win."

Whty do they have to close the kitchen at 20 on Sunday?!?! I mean there is really no reason for doing it, why should I have a pizza at midday? Just pay the damn pizza man a little bit more and make him work on sunday night, damn it!Anyway, we finally managed to come in at 19:55 and still be able to order two pizzas in three. If you are hungry, you can go for one each (Don't listen to Rob, he's just inventing as he probably ate three pizzas alone). Now, the list of pizzas is constantly changing, and that's a very good thing, as they usually have something strange among them, last time was haggis. Yes, Haggis!! and it was damn good!The pizza itself: as everybody else is saying, it's on a 20\" massive thing with one or two topping styles on it, you slice it (I love to slice pizzas!) and you eat it! The pizza is of course thin, as a 20\" Naples pizza would fill an elephant after half of it, but they are really good in not letting it become too wet in the middle, and the result is that the pizza is good both on the sides and at the center, not that easy to find, compliments to the guy who built their oven as he really know how to do his job!Other than the haggis, however, the ingredients are not that good. I mean, they are not bad, but Pilgrims is light-years far from it. Still, I loved this place, especially for us, eating pizza almost once per week, it's nice sometimes to change place, and I will surely come back to this place sooner. AND I'd love to see the damn kitchen open till 22 on Sunday. Damn."

Very fresh tasting with bold exciting flavours.The sumac yoghurt was a tad too liberally applied so overpowered the rest of the toppings but nonetheless was truly great.The real showstopper was the BBQ brisket which was an inspired choice.These pizza's are huge so one can be comfortably shared by two people unless you feel brave and go for one each (I did and had LOTS of leftovers).Drink selection was limited but they offered me a Brixton beer which is now a new fave.Win win."

Whty do they have to close the kitchen at 20 on Sunday?!?! I mean there is really no reason for doing it, why should I have a pizza at midday? Just pay the damn pizza man a little bit more and make him work on sunday night, damn it!Anyway, we finally managed to come in at 19:55 and still be able to order two pizzas in three. If you are hungry, you can go for one each (Don't listen to Rob, he's just inventing as he probably ate three pizzas alone). Now, the list of pizzas is constantly changing, and that's a very good thing, as they usually have something strange among them, last time was haggis. Yes, Haggis!! and it was damn good!The pizza itself: as everybody else is saying, it's on a 20\" massive thing with one or two topping styles on it, you slice it (I love to slice pizzas!) and you eat it! The pizza is of course thin, as a 20\" Naples pizza would fill an elephant after half of it, but they are really good in not letting it become too wet in the middle, and the result is that the pizza is good both on the sides and at the center, not that easy to find, compliments to the guy who built their oven as he really know how to do his job!Other than the haggis, however, the ingredients are not that good. I mean, they are not bad, but Pilgrims is light-years far from it. Still, I loved this place, especially for us, eating pizza almost once per week, it's nice sometimes to change place, and I will surely come back to this place sooner. AND I'd love to see the damn kitchen open till 22 on Sunday. Damn."

The waitresses are not-in-your-face cool, maneuvering around the many little tables with giant pizzas and a good attitude.The restaurant is filled with 20somethings, primarily in groups of 2, shouting at each other over jaw-droppingly/conversation-startingy large pizzas with unlikely toppings. The fairly small room is quickly filled with the impressive pizza oven, the cooks throwing their dough in the air, the waiters' explanations of how this all works, the loud music and all the chatter. You get one giant 20 inch pizza for £20 which you can split in half by topping. There are 10 choices only written on a chalkboard, because menus are so 2014.We went for the classic salami, rocket and parmesan, with mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds and chili flakes (but, were vey tempted by the goat shoulder with red kale and sumac yoghurt!). Pizzas arrived quickly and were eaten off paper plates - who needs table space for plates when you have a giant pizza? You get your own pizza slicer, which in our case led to some irregularly sized slices... Sharing napkins and condiments between tables is encouraged and adds to the warm buzz of the place.The dough was thin, the crust was soft, the toppings are very well put together. The ricotta was so fresh, the salami wasn't greasy - you can almost pretend you're eating healthily. The chili flakes and pumpkin seeds gave the pizza a kick without making it too alien. I found the bottom of the pizza a little smokier than I would have preferred, but devoured all the crust, because it was incredible. Generally, one of the best pizzas in London.We went at 10pm and there was no queue, but larger groups behind us couldn't find an available table anymore. Definitely worth a try in a small group at an awkward hour!USP: Giant sharing pizzas, good price, gourmet toppings, (cool name).Go with: Somebody you don't mind shouting at, that can both share and eat. I'd say bff, sibling, fourth date.Price: Low - £10 will fill you up!Comparison: Similar style to Franco Manca in terms of interesting toppings, dough was more similar to Pizza Pilgrims, but major wins on size of pizza for price, and collaborative atmosphere."

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around £44 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends. Also note that this place is particularly busy so it does get really loud. This doesn't diminish the excellent service that we had. I would come back again!"

The slices are extremely difficult to pick up, since the crust is paper thin. The ingredients were really fresh, and the hostess and waitress were very polite. They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was. I felt like I could barely move, and the table was so small that it was hard to fit two pizzas on it without having to adjust your elbows or plate accordingly."

I had a lunch meeting here, wich turned out more like a fun date. We decided to split a   salami and parmesan and even though I wasn't that hungry, I ended up devouring it! The slices were still boiling hot, but I kept eating and eating. The parmesan was falling of and I ended up with greasy fingers, dirty clothes but a full tummy. That pizza was the best part of my day, I swear. This is a pretty great spot for a first date, guys!"

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous maître d as well."

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (£4 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had.  That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful.  They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu. The place does get pretty full, so try to come at a time you think it will be less crowded."

Only slightly more private though as they crammed in to close to each other that the couple next to us had to move their table about a foot for me to get through the gap! The vibe is cool here though and it reminded me a lot of some of the pizza joints in New York, with the pizza taking up most of the table, no cutlery and paper plates.Our good friend Kirsty was with us this evening so we ordered a few a Camden Hells Lager each and got down to choosing our toppings. Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime. I'm very keen to go back and their interesting, exciting toppings certainly help them stand apart from the competition."

And this would be the song: When the mooooon hits your eye like a biig pizza pie, it's amoooreee....I'm not a pizza person, but Homeslice is a yummy exception I am happy to make. Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy. I appreciate that they offer the choice of flavours with tomato sauce and others with white sauce."

I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky."

Despite its size, the boys finished with their slices in seconds and I took some more time to finish eating that fat and delicious piece of pizza. The warm, almost boiling products were dripping in my mouth and the combination of flavours they create tasted like heaven. Homeslice Pizza is, for sure, one of the fastest and most delicious places to fill up with pizza. The only waiting you have to do is while the pretty baked good comes to you, as often there is a crowd of hungry people who are also waiting."

Once I'd hidden in the corner for a while.The décor is nice and I think 'nice' is the best word for it. Some school-esque coat hooks on the walls, church pew benches, couple of faux vintage mirrors, the odd chalk menu board. But it does have lovely high ceilings, so there's a very welcome sense of space - it feels relaxed, which is always good for pizza place.Homeslice does 20\" pizzas (which I'll definitely try on my own at some point - challenge accepted.) but my girlfriend and I have a couple of the £4 single slices with some of the on-tap frizzante wine. The big pizzas have some 'interesting combinations, with two in particular catching my eye for future reference: Haggis, leek & ogleshield (apparently it's a kind of cheese) and pulled pork, mint & walnut pesto.But the slices we went for, and what we thought of them, were:-    Courgette and artichoke, with a white sauce base - the garlic of the white sauce pretty much overpowered the others flavours, but I like garlic, so I really enjoyed it-    Salami and rocket, on a tomato base - very nice. Tasty and fresh. A solid thin-crust pizza, but perhaps a little light on ingredients.The frizzante was good - light, sweet, and went perfectly with the pizza. And the glass was full to the top. Vital!Overall, I actually really like Homeslice. A fairly vanilla setting, but it's so nice to be somewhere that feels light and spacious for once. The food? Tasty and pretty reasonably priced. The service? That's something that Homeslice does really well. Polite, friendly, helpful, and efficient throughout, and service wasn't added to the bill automatically - a small but nice change. Plus, we were automatically given a bottle of tap water as soon as we sat down. Civilised.I've used words like 'nice' in this review, that's exactly what I'll want every so often, and Homeslice delivers."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

The 1st time I stopped here on a Sunday evening around 3 pm and the line was out of the door with crowds milling about. I ran away.Went back at what I thought was an odd time (Monday afternoon 2 pm) and it was still packed but I managed to get a small spot to sit in after a 10 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

Time it smart (off-peak) or be prepared for a short wait or the classic leave-number-they'll-call move.Basic model: - several pizzas are by-the-sliceFor the most part, though, you're \"stuck\" (not a bad problem to have) with - the one size pie (20 inches) which, thankfully, you can get 1/2 and 1/220GBP for some delicious combinations- eggplant and harissa on a cauliflower cheese base- salami and rocket- goat shoulder and sumac yogurt- corn, chorizo and spring onion It's delicious.  Add some chili oil (or don't), enjoy the salty thin crust with just the right give...and tuck into your fair share of the pie.  Go geddit girl.  Yelp note: PROSECCO ON TAP!!!!  Double Yelp note: 2nd location opening in Fitzrovia soon!"

Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

Time it smart (off-peak) or be prepared for a short wait or the classic leave-number-they'll-call move.Basic model: - several pizzas are by-the-sliceFor the most part, though, you're \"stuck\" (not a bad problem to have) with - the one size pie (20 inches) which, thankfully, you can get 1/2 and 1/220GBP for some delicious combinations- eggplant and harissa on a cauliflower cheese base- salami and rocket- goat shoulder and sumac yogurt- corn, chorizo and spring onion It's delicious.  Add some chili oil (or don't), enjoy the salty thin crust with just the right give...and tuck into your fair share of the pie.  Go geddit girl.  Yelp note: PROSECCO ON TAP!!!!  Double Yelp note: 2nd location opening in Fitzrovia soon!"

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great.

It is a colorful and enchanting little court yard just up the road from Covent Garden filled with a few other restaurants and little shops. When I came here, there was a two hour wait time for a table. This place gets filled up quick so if you're planning on going with a group, make sure you have a reservation or go super early. Thankfully, for those eager to try it out they do offer take away by the slice. Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4£ per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!"

The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride."

The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

But trust me, nowhere in London will you find pizza this incredible. Everything is tasty. My personal favourite is their chorizo, corn and coriander pizza (trust me, it just works). They also often have a lovely courgette pizza with a white base. Everything is delicious and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend."

The 1st time I stopped here on a Sunday evening around 3 pm and the line was out of the door with crowds milling about. I ran away.Went back at what I thought was an odd time (Monday afternoon 2 pm) and it was still packed but I managed to get a small spot to sit in after a 10 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

It is a colorful and enchanting little court yard just up the road from Covent Garden filled with a few other restaurants and little shops. When I came here, there was a two hour wait time for a table. This place gets filled up quick so if you're planning on going with a group, make sure you have a reservation or go super early. Thankfully, for those eager to try it out they do offer take away by the slice. Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4£ per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!"

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

But trust me, nowhere in London will you find pizza this incredible. Everything is tasty. My personal favourite is their chorizo, corn and coriander pizza (trust me, it just works). They also often have a lovely courgette pizza with a white base. Everything is delicious and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend."

The 1st time I stopped here on a Sunday evening around 3 pm and the line was out of the door with crowds milling about. I ran away.Went back at what I thought was an odd time (Monday afternoon 2 pm) and it was still packed but I managed to get a small spot to sit in after a 10 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

The not being able to reserve a table although annoying is made up for by the fact you can put your mobile number down and go for a drink, as they call you. Generally speaking the time estimate they give you is normally accurate, my most recent visit we did end up waiting a little longer, the bonus of this though was finding a little restaurant Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Neal's Yard that let us just order wine so will definitely head there in future. I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

You can leave your phone number with them and they'll call you when a table is ready (no phoned in reservations though).The dough was perfection. There's no leaving the crust on these pizzas! I got the chorizo, corn, and scallions pizza (YES best combination of all my favorite things on one pizza). The large is....large. Very worth it. Come hungry!"

The not being able to reserve a table although annoying is made up for by the fact you can put your mobile number down and go for a drink, as they call you. Generally speaking the time estimate they give you is normally accurate, my most recent visit we did end up waiting a little longer, the bonus of this though was finding a little restaurant Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Neal's Yard that let us just order wine so will definitely head there in future. I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too)."

I didn't necessarily want an entire pizza and my husband was adamant he wasn't hungry to share one with me so I went for the slice. Perfect. This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same."

The different types of ingredients they have for the pizzas are all lovely, and the best thing is you can do half and half - The best of both worlds. Also if you think a 20inch pizza is too much they also do pizza slices by the slice. These slices are huge!I've been there a few times now and each time the experience has been great. The atmosphere and staff always makes you go back. It's definitely good for birthdays, dates, hang outs, and if you just want pizza."

But trust me, nowhere in London will you find pizza this incredible. Everything is tasty. My personal favourite is their chorizo, corn and coriander pizza (trust me, it just works). They also often have a lovely courgette pizza with a white base. Everything is delicious and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend."

The 1st time I stopped here on a Sunday evening around 3 pm and the line was out of the door with crowds milling about. I ran away.Went back at what I thought was an odd time (Monday afternoon 2 pm) and it was still packed but I managed to get a small spot to sit in after a 10 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza  slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent."

Possibly dangerous but above all just fun.Unfortunately the deliciousness of Homeslice Pizza is not a secret so you will have to queue if you want a table.

Time it smart (off-peak) or be prepared for a short wait or the classic leave-number-they'll-call move.Basic model: - several pizzas are by-the-sliceFor the most part, though, you're \"stuck\" (not a bad problem to have) with - the one size pie (20 inches) which, thankfully, you can get 1/2 and 1/220GBP for some delicious combinations- eggplant and harissa on a cauliflower cheese base- salami and rocket- goat shoulder and sumac yogurt- corn, chorizo and spring onion It's delicious.  Add some chili oil (or don't), enjoy the salty thin crust with just the right give...and tuck into your fair share of the pie.  Go geddit girl.  Yelp note: PROSECCO ON TAP!!!!  Double Yelp note: 2nd location opening in Fitzrovia soon!"

It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza."

It is a colorful and enchanting little court yard just up the road from Covent Garden filled with a few other restaurants and little shops. When I came here, there was a two hour wait time for a table. This place gets filled up quick so if you're planning on going with a group, make sure you have a reservation or go super early. Thankfully, for those eager to try it out they do offer take away by the slice. Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4£ per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!"

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride."

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

I love the simplistic pricing and all the choices and combinations you can have for pizza.Me and my boyfriend were very hungry and decided to demolish one pizza between the two of us (which I personally think is impressive!) the 20\" pizza could probably feed 3 moderately hungry guests, especially if you wanted drinks etc.We ordered our pizza with half goat shoulder and kale and half classic margarita. It is a struggle for me to decide which one is better! The goat shoulder was very tender and flavourful. It tasted well balanced with kale leaves on the pizza. The tomato sauce on the margarita half tasted very fresh and slightly sweet. I do wish we had more basil on the margarita end though. Perhaps that is something we could request next time...The location is really cute, right inside neal's yard. Warning that this place can get very full quickly! And they don't take bookings. I suggest trying to get here either earlier or later than peak dining hours or trying a Sunday evening!"

By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride."

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!"

I love the simplistic pricing and all the choices and combinations you can have for pizza.Me and my boyfriend were very hungry and decided to demolish one pizza between the two of us (which I personally think is impressive!) the 20\" pizza could probably feed 3 moderately hungry guests, especially if you wanted drinks etc.We ordered our pizza with half goat shoulder and kale and half classic margarita. It is a struggle for me to decide which one is better! The goat shoulder was very tender and flavourful. It tasted well balanced with kale leaves on the pizza. The tomato sauce on the margarita half tasted very fresh and slightly sweet. I do wish we had more basil on the margarita end though. Perhaps that is something we could request next time...The location is really cute, right inside neal's yard. Warning that this place can get very full quickly! And they don't take bookings. I suggest trying to get here either earlier or later than peak dining hours or trying a Sunday evening!"

You can leave your phone number with them and they'll call you when a table is ready (no phoned in reservations though).The dough was perfection. There's no leaving the crust on these pizzas! I got the chorizo, corn, and scallions pizza (YES best combination of all my favorite things on one pizza). The large is....large. Very worth it. Come hungry!"

Pretty messy but I'm giving it 4 star still because the toppings and sauce was delish! The crust was good too but that's because it was thicker."

I must admit, upon entering the restaurant, I was a little skeptical (as I glimpsed paper plates being used). Definitely worth saying here - don't judge a book by its cover! The pizza was incredible! We ordered a 20\" half and half (one half:chorizo, coriander and corn, second half: ricotta, mushroom and chilli) and I couldn't help but gasp in awe when it hovered above our heads and served to our table. The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion). They also provided us with a pizza cutter (which always a plus in my books), which provided me with great entertainment as I watched my friends attempting to equally divide this gigantic creation!!"

Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend.

All were good but none were great. Too little sauce on some. Too little cheese on others. Most of the toppings seemed to be just tossed onto a regular slice that was warned up for a minute or two. Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices."

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

We ordered a 20\" half and half (one half:chorizo, coriander and corn, second half: ricotta, mushroom and chilli) and I couldn't help but gasp in awe when it hovered above our heads and served to our table. The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion).

We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever.

It's filling in a carbolicious way but it has a ceiling as to how good it can really beHomeslice has a good reputation and I was able to join a little band of Yelpers yesterday to finally sample it. There was a nice smell pervading the small restaurant space in Neal's Yard when I arrived but as there's a no booking policy, our group faced a 45 minute wait on arrival. However, what was a bit off-putting was that my friend and I were given the hint twice to go away despite there being  more than enough room in the restaurant to wait. Then, no sooner had we sat down in a nearby coffeeshop when we were then summoned back as our table was ready.The small space is compact with stools and low tables but they have been clever with providing things like hooks for coats. Be prepared to share tables. The menu of pizza is up on the wall with old classics mixed with some innovative combos - all pizzas are £20 and you can mix 2 flavours on one pizza. They have an innovative way of selling wine in a large bottle and you're charged by them measuring the amount remaining in the bottle. The music was too loud with conversation taking place with uncomfortable shouting across the tableBut the food, the food, I hear you cry. Well, I did like the toppings with the butternut, bacon, stichelton and smoked onion being my favourite combo. However, the base didn't impress me - it was soft, making it hard to cut with the blunt pizza cutter. The middle of the pizza was too floppy, making eating the pizza very messy as fillings kept falling off. The edge was too doughy and most of our group left our crusts. I like my pizza bases more crispySorry, Homeslice but I can't really add my glowing love for you"

I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal."

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal."

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

It's filling in a carbolicious way but it has a ceiling as to how good it can really beHomeslice has a good reputation and I was able to join a little band of Yelpers yesterday to finally sample it. There was a nice smell pervading the small restaurant space in Neal's Yard when I arrived but as there's a no booking policy, our group faced a 45 minute wait on arrival. However, what was a bit off-putting was that my friend and I were given the hint twice to go away despite there being  more than enough room in the restaurant to wait. Then, no sooner had we sat down in a nearby coffeeshop when we were then summoned back as our table was ready.The small space is compact with stools and low tables but they have been clever with providing things like hooks for coats. Be prepared to share tables. The menu of pizza is up on the wall with old classics mixed with some innovative combos - all pizzas are £20 and you can mix 2 flavours on one pizza. They have an innovative way of selling wine in a large bottle and you're charged by them measuring the amount remaining in the bottle. The music was too loud with conversation taking place with uncomfortable shouting across the tableBut the food, the food, I hear you cry. Well, I did like the toppings with the butternut, bacon, stichelton and smoked onion being my favourite combo. However, the base didn't impress me - it was soft, making it hard to cut with the blunt pizza cutter. The middle of the pizza was too floppy, making eating the pizza very messy as fillings kept falling off. The edge was too doughy and most of our group left our crusts. I like my pizza bases more crispySorry, Homeslice but I can't really add my glowing love for you"

The 20inch half and half is definitely the way to go and I've, so far, never been disappointed.I'm also overly fond of the giant wine bottles that they then measure to work out your bill; but that's primarily because that, paired with a giant pizza, means I can pretend to be a borrower. Always a good time.I've been here a few times now and will no doubt be back again.

The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion).

When it was ready turned out they thought we said 3 people, to there credit they quickly sourced another table for three but in a different paet of the restaurant...... after a little chat with some other patrons we managed to get a table altogether. They have a good selection of beers and we had a cracking meal. The waitress was helpful with suggestions and also joined in on the lad banter that was going on.

We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever. Still, I don't feel we missed out on my first visit here.It can be busy at lunch time, but the wait was only 20 min.

For flavourful, amazing pizza, there is just no place better.They bring out gigantic 20\" pizzas and hand you a pizza cutter, at which point everyone gets stuck in! At 20 pounds a pizza I think it's very reasonable.I especially like the Corn, Chorizo, & Coriander Pizza. I'm also a huge fan of their Cauliflower Cheese Pizza (it's got some sort of venison sausage on it as well), and the Lamb Shoulder, Watercress, Tomato, Red-Wine-Soaked Goat Cheese. Pro tip: This place gets incredibly packed. Ideally, you should only come with one other person, thus minimizing your wait time. Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend. Luckily, Neal's Yard is a really cool area and there are a lot of shops/pubs to explore nearby while you wait."

All were good but none were great. Too little sauce on some. Too little cheese on others. Most of the toppings seemed to be just tossed onto a regular slice that was warned up for a minute or two. Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices."

But difinetly the 'Pizza' is good. Though I am a vegan; ( no animal by-products) a Culinary study at a California Chef Vegan school would greatly enhance your costumers smile's. The uninformed about 'vegan' foods is a bit less than one imagines....Sooooooo advertise the 'ingriedents' promotely with a 'simple' type writer size sheet of paper upon the entrance doors window...or where the menu is located outside on the window of your 'dining establishment.    Success.

Gourmet ingredients.Staff is very friendly and master at managing the masses storming the gates (and they are always storming the gates.)The place itself is chill and fun. Long, shared tables (count on a quasi-public conversation and the occasional bumped elbows), but everyone is jovial and having fun.First time I discovered this place, I ate there three times that first week. Now I have to force myself to only go twice (for my waistline) as Homeslice is just...that...good."

For flavourful, amazing pizza, there is just no place better.They bring out gigantic 20\" pizzas and hand you a pizza cutter, at which point everyone gets stuck in! At 20 pounds a pizza I think it's very reasonable.I especially like the Corn, Chorizo, & Coriander Pizza. I'm also a huge fan of their Cauliflower Cheese Pizza (it's got some sort of venison sausage on it as well), and the Lamb Shoulder, Watercress, Tomato, Red-Wine-Soaked Goat Cheese. Pro tip: This place gets incredibly packed. Ideally, you should only come with one other person, thus minimizing your wait time. Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend. Luckily, Neal's Yard is a really cool area and there are a lot of shops/pubs to explore nearby while you wait."

All were good but none were great. Too little sauce on some. Too little cheese on others. Most of the toppings seemed to be just tossed onto a regular slice that was warned up for a minute or two. Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices."

I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal."

You have a choice of a giant £20 pizza which could feed up to 4 (I'd say 3 if you like to eat) or £4 a slice (almost a quarter of a giant pizza). Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!"

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for £5.00, each.   Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza.    CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance.OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish.  If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi)."

It's filling in a carbolicious way but it has a ceiling as to how good it can really beHomeslice has a good reputation and I was able to join a little band of Yelpers yesterday to finally sample it. There was a nice smell pervading the small restaurant space in Neal's Yard when I arrived but as there's a no booking policy, our group faced a 45 minute wait on arrival. However, what was a bit off-putting was that my friend and I were given the hint twice to go away despite there being  more than enough room in the restaurant to wait. Then, no sooner had we sat down in a nearby coffeeshop when we were then summoned back as our table was ready.The small space is compact with stools and low tables but they have been clever with providing things like hooks for coats. Be prepared to share tables. The menu of pizza is up on the wall with old classics mixed with some innovative combos - all pizzas are £20 and you can mix 2 flavours on one pizza. They have an innovative way of selling wine in a large bottle and you're charged by them measuring the amount remaining in the bottle. The music was too loud with conversation taking place with uncomfortable shouting across the tableBut the food, the food, I hear you cry. Well, I did like the toppings with the butternut, bacon, stichelton and smoked onion being my favourite combo. However, the base didn't impress me - it was soft, making it hard to cut with the blunt pizza cutter. The middle of the pizza was too floppy, making eating the pizza very messy as fillings kept falling off. The edge was too doughy and most of our group left our crusts. I like my pizza bases more crispySorry, Homeslice but I can't really add my glowing love for you"

So you can imagine how I feel about the trend of London restaurants making me wait in line for  the pleasure of eating food.Luckily Homeslice avoid my wrath by letting you leave a number and wander off for a drink. Add to that that they serve basically the best pizza I've ever eaten and they've avoided my ire entirely.With an ever-changing menu a return trip can be a little heart-wrenching (oh, Lincolnshire poacher how could you desert me?) but their menu options are always amazing and original (mint pesto? sure, why not?). The 20inch half and half is definitely the way to go and I've, so far, never been disappointed.I'm also overly fond of the giant wine bottles that they then measure to work out your bill; but that's primarily because that, paired with a giant pizza, means I can pretend to be a borrower. Always a good time.I've been here a few times now and will no doubt be back again. I just hope that they manage to open a larger version at some point - it is sometimes nice not to eat with a stranger's elbow in your side..."

The rest need to be bought as a £20 pizza - its recommended you share these and the restaurant will happily make them half one topping and half another.Positives:+ Pizzas (I tried 2) were really tasty, we finished all of our pizza easily.+ There are also some imaginative options (e.g. the cauliflower cheese pizza)+ Service was quick+ Decent value for moneyOn the other hand:- Limited tables for groups of 6+- Most choices require you to buy the 20\" pizza for £20 so not great unless you're at least 2 people, really hungry (I reckon I could eat a whole one myself if necessary, they're quite thin) or happy to take leftovers home- Our crusts were very salty, I liked the taste but that much salt must be v bad...Overall: We've become very picky about our Friday lunches as spoilt for choice around Covent Garden but we agreed unanimously that we'll come back here. Well worth giving it a try if you're in the area."

There were people spilling over into our area when we first sat down, but once they left we had quite a bit more room.They keep is super simple. £20 a pie which you can order half-and-half if you like. They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's £44. (And for a magnum! That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied.

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

The pizza was a little oily but still fine.  The size is great for sharing between 2 or 3.The wine model is great - they basically just leave a massive bottle on the table and you help yourself. When you come to leave, they measure the wine drunk with a ruler and charge you accordingly.It's a little hidden away, but it's worth the search to find it - highly recommended."

They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's £44. (And for a magnum! That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied. And I know I'll be back when I'm craving one of the best pizzas in London."

The pizza came.  It was big.  It was beautiful.  It was 'just ok.\" Skip the wine in the jug. It comes from a box, and tears the tummy to bits in seconds. Stick with the cold yummy beer. Servers were fun and efficient. This  place is full of energy and happening.  I'd go back to drink and meet new people, but not for dinner."

I went here with some colleagues from work during a lunch break - what a nice spot.  Nestled into Neal's Yard inside Covent Garden, this is a great space to bring a small group.There are a bunch of pizzas to choose from (the classics all the way from black pudding or oxtaill to mushroom and ricotta).  The 20 quid whole pizza is more than enough for two people (or you can bring home!) or you can opt for couple slices at 4 quid each.  Though I ordered the  half Caprese pizza and half corn and chrizo, I was actually happier with my colleague's choice of plain ole marinara and salami at half and half.Service: Friendly and quick - they came over a few times to check on us & collect napkins - nice vibe!Food: Pizza in London is getting better and better. 3 years ago I would have been  blown away and so excited to finally have some sort of decent pizza but now with the likes of Pizza East and Rays cropping up - I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. I prefer more of a NY style pizza - and found the crust to be not so yummy and the bottom too soft and also burnt in some spaces. The sauce, though was quite yummy.If you're in the neighborhood, shopping or roaming around central - stop by for a relaxed slice or two but don't expect to have your socks totally blown off."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

I went here with some colleagues from work during a lunch break - what a nice spot.  Nestled into Neal's Yard inside Covent Garden, this is a great space to bring a small group.There are a bunch of pizzas to choose from (the classics all the way from black pudding or oxtaill to mushroom and ricotta).  The 20 quid whole pizza is more than enough for two people (or you can bring home!) or you can opt for couple slices at 4 quid each.  Though I ordered the  half Caprese pizza and half corn and chrizo, I was actually happier with my colleague's choice of plain ole marinara and salami at half and half.Service: Friendly and quick - they came over a few times to check on us & collect napkins - nice vibe!Food: Pizza in London is getting better and better. 3 years ago I would have been  blown away and so excited to finally have some sort of decent pizza but now with the likes of Pizza East and Rays cropping up - I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. I prefer more of a NY style pizza - and found the crust to be not so yummy and the bottom too soft and also burnt in some spaces. The sauce, though was quite yummy.If you're in the neighborhood, shopping or roaming around central - stop by for a relaxed slice or two but don't expect to have your socks totally blown off."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution.

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

There were people spilling over into our area when we first sat down, but once they left we had quite a bit more room.They keep is super simple. £20 a pie which you can order half-and-half if you like. They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's £44. (And for a magnum! That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied.

You can get half and half on a whole pizza which is 20 pounds or by the slice is 4. The wine we got was just a house red. Tasty for being a house wine. They give you 1.5 liters of wine and charge you for every glass you drink. There are 11 glasses in each bottle and we finished the bottle. The glasses are four pounds each so we spent 44 on wine. 64 total for 4 people in Covent garden area is not bad at all. I would recommend putting your name in and going to a nearby pub though because the wait is typically pretty long. Fabulous pizza and the weight staff was pretty friendly! I'll be going back next time I'm in London."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

Let's start with the pizza. Huge pies, thin slices, served on paper plates with no utensils. I think this might freak Londoners out, not being able to cut your pizza with a fork and knife. However, as an American who loves finger food, I'm all for it. I'm a big fan of a pie that has salami and rocket but you can do half and half, which is useful for parties with different tastes. The wine is house BUT it is perfect for those who want more than one glass but don't want to commit to a full bottle. I've only had the red-- it wasn't the best wine I've ever had, but I like that i only pay for what I drink. All in all, I would definitely recommend!"

I went here with some colleagues from work during a lunch break - what a nice spot.  Nestled into Neal's Yard inside Covent Garden, this is a great space to bring a small group.There are a bunch of pizzas to choose from (the classics all the way from black pudding or oxtaill to mushroom and ricotta).  The 20 quid whole pizza is more than enough for two people (or you can bring home!) or you can opt for couple slices at 4 quid each.  Though I ordered the  half Caprese pizza and half corn and chrizo, I was actually happier with my colleague's choice of plain ole marinara and salami at half and half.Service: Friendly and quick - they came over a few times to check on us & collect napkins - nice vibe!Food: Pizza in London is getting better and better. 3 years ago I would have been  blown away and so excited to finally have some sort of decent pizza but now with the likes of Pizza East and Rays cropping up - I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. I prefer more of a NY style pizza - and found the crust to be not so yummy and the bottom too soft and also burnt in some spaces. The sauce, though was quite yummy.If you're in the neighborhood, shopping or roaming around central - stop by for a relaxed slice or two but don't expect to have your socks totally blown off."

I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :("

I'm from New York and I've had some good pizza, but this was by far one of the best pies I've ever had. My friend and I ordered the 20 inch pie with half salami/rocket, half cauliflower cheese/auberjine/spinach.

This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!"

You can get half and half on a whole pizza which is 20 pounds or by the slice is 4. The wine we got was just a house red. Tasty for being a house wine. They give you 1.5 liters of wine and charge you for every glass you drink. There are 11 glasses in each bottle and we finished the bottle. The glasses are four pounds each so we spent 44 on wine. 64 total for 4 people in Covent garden area is not bad at all. I would recommend putting your name in and going to a nearby pub though because the wait is typically pretty long. Fabulous pizza and the weight staff was pretty friendly! I'll be going back next time I'm in London."

Let's start with the pizza. Huge pies, thin slices, served on paper plates with no utensils. I think this might freak Londoners out, not being able to cut your pizza with a fork and knife. However, as an American who loves finger food, I'm all for it. I'm a big fan of a pie that has salami and rocket but you can do half and half, which is useful for parties with different tastes. The wine is house BUT it is perfect for those who want more than one glass but don't want to commit to a full bottle. I've only had the red-- it wasn't the best wine I've ever had, but I like that i only pay for what I drink. All in all, I would definitely recommend!"

If you've got a big group, go outside of the typical lunch/dinner rushes and you should be fine. You can ask for two flavours on one 20\" pizza if you want to try more combinations. Courgette and artichoke is surprisingly good."

The last-minute actuality: Nava, Adam and I went for cocktails nearby until the other half was free and the four of us went to get some pizza. There were four of us, so no reservations, but they kindly took my phone number to call us when our table was ready.The only downside is the place is small. The tables are small. There were people spilling over into our area when we first sat down, but once they left we had quite a bit more room.They keep is super simple. £20 a pie which you can order half-and-half if you like. They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's £44. (And for a magnum! That's only £22 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for £20, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied. And I know I'll be back when I'm craving one of the best pizzas in London."

The pizza came.  It was big.  It was beautiful.  It was 'just ok.\" Skip the wine in the jug. It comes from a box, and tears the tummy to bits in seconds. Stick with the cold yummy beer. Servers were fun and efficient. This  place is full of energy and happening.  I'd go back to drink and meet new people, but not for dinner."

One was more than enough for two very hungry men.This all came for under £15 a head in Convent Garden. Home Slice feels like a friend who desperately wants you to like it and boy, it's easy to like."
